Warning: Not enough tail samples to fit the generalized Pareto distribution in some or all columns of matrix of log importance ratios. Skipping the following columns: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, ... [96 more not printed].

Warning messages:
1: Relative effective sample sizes ('r_eff' argument) not specified.
For models fit with MCMC, the reported PSIS effective sample sizes and 
MCSE estimates will be over-optimistic. 
2: Some Pareto k diagnostic values are too high. See help('pareto-k-diagnostic') for details.
