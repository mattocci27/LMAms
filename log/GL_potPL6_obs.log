Warning messages:
1: There were 1 divergent transitions after warmup. Increasing adapt_delta above 0.8 may help. See
http://mc-stan.org/misc/warnings.html#divergent-transitions-after-warmup 
2: Examine the pairs() plot to diagnose sampling problems
 
3: There were 181 divergent transitions after warmup. Increasing adapt_delta above 0.95 may help. See
http://mc-stan.org/misc/warnings.html#divergent-transitions-after-warmup 
4: There were 3 chains where the estimated Bayesian Fraction of Missing Information was low. See
