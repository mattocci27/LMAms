Cross-reference of manually labeled equations in word documents

In the example below, I want to label `g = h + i` with `(2)` but it starts from `(1)`. This can be handled with `\stepcounter{}` for LaTex but it doesn't work for word documents. Is it possible to do cross-reference of manually labeled equations in word documents?

$$
a = b + c \qquad(1a)

$$
d = e + f \qquad(1b)

$$
g = h + i
$$ {#eq-test}

$$
j = k + l
$$ {#eq-test2}
