# Appendix S1: Prior information

The logarithms of *A*~area~, *R*~area~, and LL for leaf sample *i* were assumed to have a multivariate normal distribution as following:

\begin{align}
\left(
\begin{array}{ccc}
\mathrm{ln}[A_{\mathrm{area} \, i}]\\
\mathrm{ln}[R_{\mathrm{area} \, i}] \\
\mathrm{ln}[\mathrm{LL}_i]
\end{array}
\right)
\sim \mathrm{MVN}
\left(
\begin{array}{rrr}
\mathrm{E}[A_{\mathrm{area} \, i}]\\
\mathrm{E}[R_{\mathrm{area} \, i}] &, \boldsymbol{\Sigma}\\
\mathrm{E}[\mathrm{LL}_i]
\end{array}
\right) \tag{S1}
\end{align}

where E[$\cdot$] indicates expected value; $\boldsymbol{\Sigma}$ indicates a covariance matrix.
Expected values are based on Eqs. 1-6 in the main text.

We used non-informative or weakly informative prior distributions [@Lemoine2019].
The covariance mkatrix in Eq. S1 was decomposed as ${\mathbf \Sigma} = {\mathrm diag}({\mathbf \sigma}){\mathbf \Omega}{\mathrm diag}({\mathbf \sigma}) = {\mathrm diag}({\mathbf \sigma}){\mathbf L}{\mathbf L}\prime {\mathrm diag}({\mathbf \sigma})$ using a Cholesky decomposition, where ${\mathbf \sigma}$ is a vector of $\sigma_{1}$, $\sigma_{2}$, and $\sigma_{3}$;  ${\mathbf \Omega}$ is a correlation matrix of $\rho_{12}$, $\rho_{13}$, and $\rho_{23}$; and **L** is a lower triangular matrix.
Instead of assigning prior distributions on directly, priors were assigned on and **L** to avoid a strong dependence between and [@Lewandowski2009; @Alvarez2014].
A prior for **L** was specified as a so-called LKJ distribution with shape parameter 2 [@Lewandowski2009], which is weakly informative for the correlation matrix.
A prior for ${\mathrm diag}({\mathbf \sigma})$ was specified as a Half-Cauchy distribution with location 0 and scale 5, which is weakly informative and allows for occasional large coefficients while still performing a reasonable amount of shrinkage for coefficients near zero [@Gelman2008].
A prior for $\mathbf{\sigma}$ was specified as a Half-Cauchy distribution with location 0 and scale 5, which is weakly informative and allows for occasional large coefficients while still performing a reasonable amount of shrinkage for coefficients near zero [@Gelman2008].
Priors for $\alpha_{0,p,s}$, $\beta_{0,p,s}$, and $\gamma_{0,p,s}$ in Eqs. 4-6 were weakly informative and specified as normal distributions with mean 0 and standard deviation 5.
Priors for *f~i~* in Eqs. 4-6 were non-informative and specified as uniform distributions with range (0, 1).

# Appendix S2: Randomization (including Table AS1 and Figure AS1)

We generated 10 randomized datasets for each of the GLOPNET and the Panama datasets by shuffling each trait value across leaf samples, and fit the best models (Appendix S1) to the randomized data.

## Table AS1

- No_large_Rhat: The number of parameters (including transformed parameters) that shows Rhat (Gelman-Rubin statistic) greater than 1.05.
- No_divergence: The number of iterations that shows divergent transitions.

```{r randtab, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
d <- read_csv("../data/rand.csv") |>
  dplyr::select(Data = data, Simulation_ID = sim_id, No_large_Rhat = rhat, No_divergence = div)

if ("html" == knitr::opts_knit$get("rmarkdown.pandoc.to")) {
  # knitr::kable(d, format = "pipe", escape = FALSE) |>
  kable(d) |>
    #kable_styling()
    kable_classic(full_width = FALSE)
} else if ("docx" == knitr::opts_knit$get("rmarkdown.pandoc.to")) {
  d |>
    kable(format = "pipe", escape = FALSE) |>
    kable_classic(full_width = FALSE)
} else if ("latex" == knitr::opts_knit$get("rmarkdown.pandoc.to")) {
  d |>
    kable(format = "pipe", escape = FALSE) |>
    kable_classic(full_width = FALSE)
}
```

Model results obtained from the randomized datasets did not convergent based on the Gelman-Rubin statistic or showed divergent transitions.

\newpage

## Figure AS1

Although divergent transitions suggesting that the posterior distribution is not reliable, we checked the regression coefficients for GLOPNET ($\alpha_{0, p, s}$, $\beta_{0, s}$, and $\gamma_{0, p, s}$ in Eqs. 4-6 in the main text).
There are 10 independent simulations (randomizations) in total.
The simulation ID 2, 3, 4 and 7 were convergent based on the Gelman-Rubin statistic, but those randomized datasets did not show any patterns.
Thus, the tests with randomized data indicate that our model is not inherently prone to overfitting or to producing patterns from noise.

# Figure S1

Pearson correlation coefficients for posterior medians of LMAp vs LMAs in the (a) GLOPNET and (b) Panama datasets.
The non-significant or weak *r* values indicate that a single axis could not accurately represent the two-dimensional space.
Symbols as in Main Text Figs. 1-2.

# Figure S2

Boxplots comparing leaf mass per area (LMA), photosynthetic leaf mass per area (LMAp; posterior means), and structural leaf mass per area (LMAs; posterior means) across sites (wet and dry) and canopy strata (sun and shade) in Panama.
The results shown here include all leaves in the Panama dataset, whereas Fig. 5 in the main text only includes Panama species for which both sun and shade leaves were available.
Boxplot symbols as in Fig. 5.
Groups sharing the same letters are not significantly different (P > 0.05; t-tests).

Mass-prop

\newpage

# Figure S4

Measured traits related to photosynthesis and metabolism (nitrogen and phosphorus per-unit leaf area; *N*~area~ and *P*~area~) are positively correlated with LMA and with estimates (posterior means) of the photosynthetic and structural LMA components (LMAp and LMAs, respectively) in the GLOPNET dataset.
LMAp yields stronger correlations and more consistent relationships compared to LMA and LMAs; e.g., evergreen and deciduous leaves align along a single relationship in panel b, but not in panels a or c.

## Stan code for the GLOPNET dataset

The best model for the GLOPNET dataset is (2) LMAp and LMAs, and (b) $\alpha_p > \alpha_s$ and $\beta_p = 0$.

```{stan, output.var="hoge",file="../stan/GL_Aps_LLs.stan", eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}

## Stan code for the Panama dataset

The best model for the Panama dataset is (4) LMAp, LMAs and light, and (a) $\alpha_s = 0$  and $\beta_p = 0$,
