# Appendix S1: Prior information

The logarithms of *A*~area~, *R*~area~, and LL for leaf sample *i* were assumed to have a multivariate normal distribution:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\left(
\begin{array}{ccc}
\mathrm{ln}(A_{\mathrm{area} \, i})\\
\mathrm{ln}(R_{\mathrm{area} \, i}) \\
\mathrm{ln}(\mathrm{LL}_i)
\end{array}
\right)
\sim \mathrm{MVN}
\left(
\begin{array}{rrr}
\mathrm{E}[A_{\mathrm{area} \, i}] & \\
\mathrm{E}[R_{\mathrm{area} \, i}] &, \boldsymbol{\Sigma}\\
\mathrm{E}[\mathrm{LL}_i] &
\end{array}
\right) \qquad(\mathrm{S}1)
\end{aligned}
$$

where E[$\cdot$] indicates expected value and $\boldsymbol{\Sigma}$ indicates a covariance matrix.
Expected values are based on Eqs. `r eq_num("Aarea")`-`r eq_num("LL")` in the main text.

We used non-informative or weakly informative prior distributions [@Lemoine2019].
The covariance matrix in Eq. S1 was decomposed as ${\mathbf \Sigma} = \mathrm {diag}(\mathbf {\sigma}){\mathbf \Omega}\mathrm {diag}({\mathbf \sigma}) = \mathrm {diag}({\mathbf \sigma}){\mathbf L}{\mathbf L}\prime \mathrm {diag}({\mathbf \sigma})$ using a Cholesky decomposition, where $\mathbf {\sigma}$ is a vector of $\sigma_{1}$, $\sigma_{2}$, and $\sigma_{3}$;  ${\mathbf \Omega}$ is a correlation matrix of $\rho_{12}$, $\rho_{13}$, and $\rho_{23}$; and **L** is a lower triangular matrix.
Instead of assigning prior distributions on $\boldsymbol{\Sigma}$ directly, priors were assigned on ${\mathbf \sigma}$ and **L** to avoid a strong dependence between ${\mathbf \sigma}$ and ${\mathbf \Omega}$ [@Lewandowski2009; @Alvarez2014].
A prior for **L** was specified as a so-called LKJ distribution with shape parameter 2 [@Lewandowski2009], which is weakly informative for the correlation matrix.
A prior for $\mathbf{\sigma}$ was specified as a Half-Cauchy distribution with location 0 and scale 2.5, which is weakly informative and allows for occasional large coefficients while still performing a reasonable amount of shrinkage for coefficients near zero [@Gelman2008].
Priors for $\alpha_{0,m,s}$, $\beta_{0,m,s}$, and $\gamma_{0,m,s}$ in Eqs. `r eq_num("Aarea")`-`r eq_num("LL")` were weakly informative and specified as normal distributions with mean 0 and standard deviation 5.
Priors for *f~i~* in Eqs. `r eq_num("LMA")`-`r eq_num("LL")` were non-informative and specified as uniform distributions with range (0, 1).

# Appendix S2: Model tests with randomized data  (including Table AS1 and Figure AS1)

We generated 10 randomized datasets for each of the GLOPNET and the Panama datasets by randomly shuffling each trait value across leaf samples, and we fit the best models (`r table("looic")`) to the randomized data.

Most of the model results obtained from the randomized datasets did not convergent based on the Gelman-Rubin statistic or showed divergent transitions (Table AS1), indicating that models fit to randomized data do not provide reliable inferences [@Betancourt2016].

## Table AS1

- No_large_Rhat: The number of parameters (including transformed parameters) that shows Rhat (Gelman-Rubin statistic) greater than 1.1.

- No_divergence: The number of iterations that shows divergent transitions.

```{r randtab, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
d <- read_csv(here("data/sim_summary_diagnostics.csv")) #|>
  # dplyr::select(Data = data, Simulation_ID = sim_id, No_large_Rhat = rhat, No_divergence = div)

if ("html" == knitr::opts_knit$get("rmarkdown.pandoc.to")) {
  # knitr::kable(d, format = "pipe", escape = FALSE) |>
  kable(d) |>
    #kable_styling()
    kable_classic(full_width = FALSE)
} else if ("docx" == knitr::opts_knit$get("rmarkdown.pandoc.to")) {
  d |>
    kable(format = "pipe", escape = FALSE) |>
    kable_classic(full_width = FALSE)
} else if ("latex" == knitr::opts_knit$get("rmarkdown.pandoc.to")) {
  d |>
    kable(format = "pipe", escape = FALSE) |>
    kable_classic(full_width = FALSE)
}
```

## Figure AS1

Although many parameters in models fit to randomized data had large Rhat values (Table AS1), which suggests that the posterior distributions did not converge, we nevertheless examined the regression coefficients to evaluate if our model framework is prone to overfitting.
Figure AS1 shows the regression coefficients for the randomized GLOPNET data ($\alpha_{0, m, s}$, $\beta_{0, s}$, and $\gamma_{0, m, s}$ in Eqs. `r eq_num("Aarea")`-`r eq_num("LL")` in the main text).
There are 10 independent simulations (randomizations) in total.
Points and lines indicate posterior medians and 95% credible intervals (CIs), respectively.
Although intercepts were significant, the scaling parameters ($\alpha_{m, s}$, $\beta_{s}$, and $\gamma_{m, s}$) obtained for the randomized datasets were not significantly different from zero.
These tests with randomized data indicate that our model is not inherently prone to overfitting or to producing patterns from noise.

## Figure AS2

Figure AS2 showsWe also checked the regression coefficients for the randomized Panama dataset ($\alpha_{0, m}$, $\beta_{0, s}$, $\gamma_{0, m, s}$, and $\theta$ in Eqs.`r eq_num("Aarea")`-`r eq_num("LL")` in the main text).
Details as for Figure AS1.
The scaling parameters ($\alpha_{m}$, $\beta_{s}$, and $\gamma_{m, s}$) and the effect of light on leaf lifespan ($\theta$) were not significantly different from zeroin the randomized datasets did not show any patterns.
Again, these tests with randomized data indicate that our model is not inherently prone to overfitting or to producing patterns from noise.

# Appendix S3: Simulated datasets to study relationships between photosynthetic capacity and LMA

To create simulated datasets to study relationships between photosynthetic capacity and LMA (i.e., mass- vs. area-dependence of *A*~max~), we generated lognormally distributed LMAm and LMAs values by sampling ln(LMAm) and ln(LMAs) from normal distributions.
For GLPONET and Panama sun leaves, results from the LMAm-LMAs models (Eqs. `r eq_num("Aarea")`-`r eq_num("LL")`) indicated little correlation between LMAm and LMAs, so we used univariate normal distributions (N) to generate the LMAm and LMAs samples:

$$
\mathrm{ln}(\mathrm{LMAm}) \sim N(\mathrm{ln}(\mu_m), \sigma_m)
$$

$$
\mathrm{ln}(\mathrm{LMAs}) \sim N(\mathrm{ln}(\mu_s), \sigma_s)
$$

where
$\mathrm{ln}(\mu_m)$ and $\mathrm{ln}(\mu_s)$ are the means of LMAm and LMAs, respectively, on the log-scale and
$\sigma_m$ and $\sigma_s$ are the corresponding standard deviations.

For Panama shade leaves, LMAm-LMAs model results indicated a negative correlation between LMAm and LMAs, so we used a multivariate normal distribution (MVN) to generate the LMAm and LMAs samples:

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
\mathrm{ln}(\mathrm{LMAm})\\
\mathrm{ln}(\mathrm{LMAs})
\end{bmatrix}
\sim \mathrm{MVN}
\left[
\begin{matrix}
\ln(\mu_{m})\\
\ln(\mu_{s})
\end{matrix}
,\mathbf{\Sigma}
\right]
$$

$$
\mathbf{\Sigma} = \
\begin{bmatrix}
\sigma_m^2 & \rho \sigma_m \sigma_s \\
\rho \sigma_m \sigma_s & \sigma_s^2 \\
\end{bmatrix}
$$

where $\boldsymbol{\Sigma}$ is the covariance matrix of ln(LMAm) and ln(LMAs), and
$\rho$ is the correlation coefficient between ln(LMAm) and ln(LMAs).

To create simulated datasets (each with a sample size of 100) in which LMAs accounted for different fractions of the total LMA variance, we used the predictions (posterior medians) of LMAm and LMAs for each leaf sample from the best models (`r table("params")`) to estimate $\mu_m$, $\mu_s$, $\sigma_m$, and $\rho$; and varied $\sigma_s$ from ln(1.01) to ln(10) across simulated datasets.
For each of the 100 leaves in a given simulated dataset, *A*~area~ was calculated according to `r eq("Aarea")`.

Parameter values were,
$\mu_m$ = `r para$GL$LMAm_mu_gl`,
$\mu_s$ = `r para$GL$LMAs_mu_gl`,
$\sigma_m$ = `r para$GL$LMAm_sig_gl`,
$\alpha_m$ = `r para$GL$am`, and
$\alpha_s$ = `r para$GL$as`,
for GLOPNET;
$\mu_m$ = `r para$PA$LMAm_mu_sun`,
$\mu_s$ = `r para$PA$LMAs_mu_sun`,
$\sigma_m$ = `r para$PA$LMAm_sig_sun`,
$\alpha_m$ = `r para$PA$am`, and
$\alpha_s$ = 0,
for Panama sun leaves; and
$\mu_m$ = `r para$PA$LMAm_mu_shade`,
$\mu_s$ = `r para$PA$LMAs_mu_shade`,
$\sigma_m$ = `r para$PA$LMAm_sig_shade`,
$\alpha_m$ = `r para$PA$am`,
$\alpha_s$ = 0, and
$\rho$ = `r para$PA$rho_shade`.
for Panama shade leaves.

For each simulated dataset, we quantified the mass-dependence (*b*) using the ordinary least squares regression from `r eq("mass")`.
We repeated these steps 1000 times for each set of parameter values.

**`r s_fig("mass_prop_sim")`**:
The relationships between mass dependency (*b* in Equation 5 in the main text) and relative variance in LMAs to LMA for the different ranges of the scaling exponent $\alpha_m$ and $\alpha_s$.
(a) the scaling exponent $\alpha_m$ vary from 0.1 to 1.0 while the scaling exponent $\alpha_s$ is constant ($\alpha_s$ = `r para$GL$as`,).
(b) the scaling exponent $\alpha_s$ vary from -0.5 to 0.5 while the scaling exponent $\alpha_m$ is constant ($\alpha_m$ = `r para$GL$am`,).
Solid lines indicate simulated medians and shaded regions indicate 95% confidence intervals.
The photosynthetic rate (*A*~max~) is primarily mass-dependent (*b* > 0.5), primarily area-dependent (0.5 > *b* > 0) and purely area-dependent (*b* = 0) [@Osnas2018].
If *b* > 1, then *A*~max~ increases exponentially with LMA, which is not consistent with observed relationships [@Osnas2018].
Parameter settings:
$\alpha_0$ = `r para$GL$a0`,
$\mu_m$ = `r para$GL$LMAm_mu_gl`,
$\mu_s$ = `r para$GL$LMAs_mu_gl`, and

LMAm yields more consistent relationships compared to LMA and LMAs; e.g., evergreen and deciduous leaves align along a single relationship in panel b, but not in panels a or c.
Pearson correlation coefficients (*r*) for LMA (left column) and posterior medians of Pearson correlation coefficients ($\bar{r}$) for LMAm (middle column) and LMAs (right column) are shown.

The partial regression plots show separation between sun and shade when controlling for LMAs variation (i.e., LMAs does not explain the sun/shade difference), but overlapping distributions of sun and shade when controlling for LMAm variation (i.e., LMAm does explain the sun/shade difference).
Posterior medians of partial correlation coefficients ($\bar{\rho}$) are shown.
