\section{Abstract}\label{abstract}}

• Across the global flora, photosynthetic and metabolic rates depend
more strongly on leaf area than leaf mass. In contrast, intraspecific
variation in these rates is strongly mass-dependent. These contrasting
patterns suggest that the causes of variation in leaf mass per area
(LMA) may be fundamentally different within vs.~among species.

• We used statistical methods to decompose LMA into two conceptual
components -- `photosynthetic' LMAm (which determines photosynthetic
capacity and metabolic rates, and also affects optimal leaf lifespan)
and `structural' LMAs (which determines leaf toughness and potential
leaf lifespan) using leaf trait data from tropical forest sites in
Panama and a global leaf-trait database.

• Statistically decomposing LMA into LMAm and LMAs provides improved
predictions of trait variation (photosynthesis, respiration, and
lifespan) across the global flora, and within and among tropical plant
species in Panama. Our analysis shows that most interspecific LMA
variation is due to LMAs (which explains why photosynthetic and
metabolic traits are area-dependent across species) and that
intraspecific LMA variation is due to changes in both LMAm and LMAs
(which explains why photosynthetic and metabolic traits are
mass-dependent within species).

• Our results suggest that leaf trait variation is multi-dimensional and
is not well-represented by the one-dimensional leaf economics spectrum.

\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}}

Over the past two decades, the `leaf economics spectrum' (LES) (Reich,
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Reich2014}{2014}; Reich, Walters, \& Ellsworth,
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Reich1997}{1997}; I. J. Wright et al.,
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Wright2004a}{2004}) has become a cornerstone of
plant ecology. The LES captures tight relationships among leaf mass per
area (LMA), leaf lifespan (LL), and mass-normalized leaf traits related
to carbon fixation and nutrient use, suggesting the presence of a single
dominant axis of leaf functional variation, ranging from short-lived
leaves with high photosynthetic potential and fast returns on investment
to long-lived leaves with low photosynthetic potential and slow returns
(Reich, \protect\hyperlink{ref-Reich2014}{2014}; Westoby,
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Westoby2006}{2006}; I. J. Wright et al.,
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Wright2004a}{2004}). Because the mass-based LES
constrains variation in green leaf traits to a single axis, it has been
proposed as a simple framework for incorporating more realistic levels
of leaf trait diversity in global carbon-climate models (Bonan, Levis,
Kergoat, \& Oleson, \protect\hyperlink{ref-Bonan2002}{2002}; S. Joseph
Wright et al., \protect\hyperlink{ref-Wright2004}{2004}). However,
recent analyses suggest that the one-dimensional LES is largely the
result of high interspecific variation in LMA combined with
mass-normalization of area-dependent traits (Lloyd, Bloomfield,
Domingues, \& Farquhar, \protect\hyperlink{ref-Lloyd2013}{2013}; Osnas,
Lichstein, Reich, \& Pacala, \protect\hyperlink{ref-Osnas2013}{2013}).

The essence of the problem follows (see Osnas et al.
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Osnas2013}{2013}) and Notes S1 for details). Let
X represent the whole-leaf value of a purely area-dependent trait; i.e.,
X is proportional to leaf area, where X could be the photosynthetic
capacity of the entire leaf (units = moles CO\textsubscript{2} fixed
per-unit time), the amount of nitrogen in the entire leaf (units = grams
of nitrogen), etc. The mass-normalized trait value would then be X/Mass,
which (assuming X is proportional to leaf area) is proportional to
Area/Mass = LMA\textsuperscript{-1}. This simplistic example shows that
if traits are actually area-dependent, mass normalization can introduce
spurious correlations; i.e., in this example, X/Mass is proportional to
LMA\textsuperscript{-1}, even though X is assumed to depend only on leaf
area. Thus, the strong correlations observed among LMA and
mass-normalized traits (Reich et al.,
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Reich1997}{1997}; Wright et al.,
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Wright2004}{2004}) should not be taken as
evidence for a single dominant axis of leaf functional variation (Lloyd
et al., \protect\hyperlink{ref-Lloyd2013}{2013}; Osnas et al.,
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Osnas2013}{2013}).

An important observation suggesting the presence of multiple axes of
leaf functional variation is that trait relationships across species are
sometimes inconsistent with those observed within species. For example,
across species in the global flora, LMA has a strong, positive
relationship with LL but a weak relationship with net photosynthetic
capacity per-unit leaf area (\emph{A}\textsubscript{area}) (Wright et
al., \protect\hyperlink{ref-Wright2004}{2004}). In contrast,
intraspecific variation in these traits across vertical canopy (light)
gradients shows the opposite pattern: within species, LMA has a weak
and/or negative relationship with LL (Lusk, Reich, Montgomery, Ackerly,
\& Cavender-Bares, \protect\hyperlink{ref-Lusk2008}{2008}; Osada,
Takeda, Furukawa, \& Awang, \protect\hyperlink{ref-Osada2001}{2001};
Russo \& Kitajima, \protect\hyperlink{ref-Russo2016}{2016}) but a
strong, positive relationship with \emph{A}\textsubscript{area}
(Ellsworth \& Reich, \protect\hyperlink{ref-Ellsworth1993}{1993}; Kenzo
et al., \protect\hyperlink{ref-Kenzo2006}{2006}; Niinemets, Keenan, \&
Hallik, \protect\hyperlink{ref-Niinemets2015}{2015}). These contrasting
patterns suggest that the causes of LMA variation may be fundamentally
different within vs.~among species. Furthermore, variation in four
traits related to photosynthesis and metabolism -- net photosynthetic
capacity, dark respiration rate, and concentrations of nitrogen and
phosphorus -- are primarily mass-dependent among species within some
plant functional groups, and primarily area-dependent within others
(Osnas et al., in review). Thus, leaf trait relationships diverge in a
number of intra- and interspecific comparisons, suggesting the presence
of multiple axes of functional variation that can combine in different
ways to create a variety of patterns.

A conceptual model that might explain these divergent patterns is to
view LMA as being comprised of two primary components --
`photosynthetic' leaf mass (LMAm, which determines photosynthetic
capacity and associated metabolic activity, such as phloem-loading) and
structural leaf mass (LMAs, which determines toughness and thus
potential LL) (Osnas et al., in review). This conceptual model can
potentially explain the above divergent trait patterns, because
variation in LMAm leads to mass-dependence of photosynthetic and
metabolic traits, whereas variation in LMAs leads to area-dependence of
these same traits (Notes S2). Thus, the degree of area-
vs.~mass-dependence in a given leaf assemblage should, according to this
conceptual model, depend on the relative contributions of LMAm and LMAs
to total LMA variation in the assemblage.

A challenge to implementing the above conceptual model is the absence of
direct measurements of LMAm and LMAs. Although some leaf mass components
are clearly associated with certain functions (e.g., chloroplasts
perform photosynthesis), it is difficult to neatly partition some leaf
mass components to specific functions. For example, thick cell walls
provide structural toughness and allow for long LL (Kitajima et al.,
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Kitajima2012}{2012}), but a leaf without any cell
wall mass would lack the biomechanical support needed to intercept light
and perform photosynthesis. Thus, it is difficult to determine how much
of the cell wall mass present in a leaf was constructed for
photosynthesis and associated metabolic functions, vs.~how much
additional cell wall mass was constructed for the purpose of prolonging
LL. Despite this challenge, it should be possible to use multivariate
trait datasets to statistically partition LMA into LMAm and LMAs,
because statistical relationships among net photosynthetic capacity
(\emph{A}\textsubscript{max}), dark respiration rate
(\emph{R}\textsubscript{dark}), LMA, and LL should hold clues regarding
the allocation of leaf mass to photosynthetic vs.~structural functions.

In this paper, we explore the above conceptual model using leaf trait
data from two tropical forest sites (sun and shade leaves from wet and
dry sites in Panama) and the GLOPNET global leaf traits database (I. J.
Wright et al., \protect\hyperlink{ref-Wright2004a}{2004}). For
simplicity, our analysis assume that LMA is equal to the sum of separate
additive components, LMAm and LMAs. The goal of our analysis is to
evaluate if the conceptual model described above can explain divergent
patterns in leaf trait data, and if so, to use the model to elucidate
the causes of these divergent patterns. First, we describe a statistical
modeling framework to estimate LMAm and LMAs, and we use simulations to
show that the model yields robust results that are not prone to
statistical artifacts. Then, we ask the following questions: (1) Does
decomposing LMA into photosynthetic and structural components lead to
improved predictions of \emph{A}\textsubscript{max},
\emph{R}\textsubscript{dark}, and LL? (2) What is the relative
importance of LMAm vs.~LMAs in explaining variation in LMA within and
among species? (3) Do LMAm and LMAs differ between evergreen and
deciduous species, and between sun and shade leaves? and (4) How are
measurable leaf photosynthetic and structural traits (e.g.,
concentrations of nitrogen and cellulose) related to LMAm and LMAs?

Our model is conceptually similar to that of Shipley, Lechowicz, Wright,
\& Reich (\protect\hyperlink{ref-Shipley2006}{2006}), which explained
the LES in terms of a tradeoff between the volume of a leaf allocated to
cell wall vs.~protoplasm. An important difference between our analysis
and that of Shipley et al. (2006) is that our goal is to understand
divergent trait patterns within vs.~among species, whereas Shipley et
al. (\protect\hyperlink{ref-Shipley2006}{2006}) focused only on
interspecific variation. Because we treat LMA as the sum of LMAm and
LMAs without considering how these mass components are packaged within a
leaf, our model ignores the effects of leaf anatomy. For example, a
given cell wall mass per leaf area may be packaged into a large surface
area with thin walls (high mesophyll conductance and
\emph{A}\textsubscript{max}, but low structural toughness) or a small
surface area with thick walls (low mesophyll conductance and
\emph{A}\textsubscript{max}, but high structural toughness) (Onoda et
al., \protect\hyperlink{ref-Onoda2017}{2017}). Despite its lack of
anatomical detail, our model explains much of the inter- and
intraspecific variation in \emph{A}\textsubscript{max},
\emph{R}\textsubscript{dark}, and LL (see Results) and provides novel
insights into the causes of divergent patterns of trait variation within
vs.~among species (see Discussion).

\hypertarget{model-overview}{%
\subsection{Model overview}\label{model-overview}}

We developed a statistical modeling framework to partition LMA into
additive LMAs and LMAm components (see below and Notes S3). For sample
\emph{i} (where `sample' refers to a species, or a species × canopy
position combination; see Datasets below), we partition
LMA\textsubscript{\emph{i}} into LMAm\textsubscript{\emph{i}} =
f\textsubscript{\emph{i}} × LMA\textsubscript{\emph{i}} and
LMAs\textsubscript{\emph{i}} = (1 -- \emph{f\textsubscript{i}}) ×
LMA\textsubscript{\emph{i}} by estimating a latent variable
\emph{f\textsubscript{i}}. The latent variables
\emph{f\textsubscript{i}} are not directly observed, but they can be
constrained by available data using Bayesian methods (Bishop,
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Bishop2006}{2006}; Gelman \& Hill,
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Gelman2006}{2006}). For example, posterior
distributions for LMAm\textsubscript{\emph{i}} should tend to converge
on high values for leaves with high \emph{A}\textsubscript{area}, and
posterior distributions for LMAs\textsubscript{\emph{i}} should tend to
converge on high values for leaves with high LL. Given the large number
of free parameters (i.e., one latent variable per leaf sample), it is
possible for the model to over-fit the data, which could lead to
spurious inferences. Therefore, we performed tests with randomized data
(see below) and with simulated data to evaluate model performance under
a range of conditions (Notes S4). Tests with simulated data suggest that
our modeling approach is robust and not prone to producing artefactual
results.

Modeling leaf lifespan, photosynthetic capacity, and dark respiration in
relation to photosynthetic and structural leaf mass components We assume
that the sum of photosynthetic leaf mass per area (LMAm) and structural
leaf mass per area (LMAs) is equal to total observed LMA for leaf sample
\emph{i} (where a `sample' is a species in the GLOPNET dataset, or a
species × canopy position combination in the Panama dataset):

\begin{align}
  &\mathrm{LMA}_{i} =\mathrm{LMAm}_{i} + \mathrm{LMAs}_{i} \label{eq:LMA}\\
  &\mathrm{LMAm}_{i} = f_{i} \mathrm{LMA}_{i} \label{eq:LMAm}\\
  &\mathrm{LMAs}_{i} = (1 - f_{i})  \mathrm{LMA}_{i}\label{eq:LMAs}
\end{align}

where, \emph{f\textsubscript{i}} is the fraction of
LMA\textsubscript{\emph{i}} that is comprised of
LMAm\textsubscript{\emph{i}}. The \emph{f\textsubscript{i}} terms are
not directly observed but can be estimated as latent variables in a
Bayesian modeling framework (see details below). In our model, net
photosynthetic capacity (\emph{A}\textsubscript{area}) is determined by
LMAm, LL is determined by LMAs, and total leaf dark respiration is
determined by both metabolic and structural tissues:

\begin{align}
& A_{\mathrm{area} \; i}
= \alpha_0\mathrm{LMAm}_{i}^{\alpha_m} \epsilon_{1i} =  \alpha_0 f_i \mathrm{LMA}_{i}^{\alpha_m} \epsilon_{1i} \\
& \mathrm{LL_i} = \beta_0\mathrm{LMAs}_{i}^{\beta_s} \epsilon_{2i}  = \beta_0 (1 - f_i)\mathrm{LMAs}_{i}^{\beta_s} \epsilon_{2i}\\
& R_{\mathrm{area} \; i}
= \gamma_0\mathrm{LMAm}_{i}^{\gamma_m} \mathrm{LMAs}_{i}^{\gamma_s} \epsilon_{3i}
= \gamma_0 f_i \mathrm{LMA}_{i}^{\gamma_m}  (1-f_i)\mathrm{LMA}_{i}^{\gamma_s} \epsilon_{3i}
\end{align}

where, \emph{A}\textsubscript{area} \textsubscript{\emph{i}},
\emph{R}\textsubscript{area} \textsubscript{\emph{i}}, and
LL\textsubscript{\emph{i}}, are, respectively, the net photosynthetic
rate (\emph{A}\textsubscript{max}) per unit area, dark respiration rate
(\emph{R}\textsubscript{dark}) per unit area, and leaf life span of leaf
\emph{i}; \(x_0\) is fitted constant; and \(x_m\) and \(x_s\) quantify
how traits depend on metabolic and structural tissues, respectively; and
\(\epsilon_{1-3i}\) are sample specific random variables. Eq.
\eqref{eq:E-LL} is labeled ``Potential LL Model'', because this model
assumes that LL is depended only on structural toughness, in contrast to
an alternative model based on optimal LL theory (see Eqs.
\eqref{eq:kikuzawa} - \eqref{eq:optLLmu} below). The logarithms of net
photosynthesis, LL, and \emph{R}\textsubscript{area} are assumed to have
normal distributions (N); e.g.,
\(\rm{E}[A_{\mathrm{area} \; i}] = \mathrm{ln}\alpha_0 + \mathrm{ln}f_i + \alpha_m \mathrm{lnLMA}_i -\sigma_{1i}/2\),
where E{[}\(\cdot\){]} is the expected value of the variable in brackets
on the log-scale and \(\sigma_1i\) is the standard deviation of
\$\rm{E}[A\_\{\rm{area}].

In addition to Eq. \eqref{eq:E-LL} (Potential LL Model), we considered an
alternative assumption for the relationship between LL and other traits
based on optimal LL theory (Kikuzawa,
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Kikuzawa1991}{1991}; Kikuzawa, Onoda, Wright, \&
Reich, \protect\hyperlink{ref-Kikuzawa2013}{2013}; Kikuzawa, Shirakawa,
Suzuki, \& Umeki, \protect\hyperlink{ref-Kikuzawa2004}{2004}). According
to this theory, since \emph{A}\textsubscript{area} declines with leaves
age, plants tend to replace leaves with high
\emph{A}\textsubscript{area} with new leaves before their potential LL
in order to maximizes lifetime carbon gain per-unit time. Thus, Eq.
\eqref{eq:kikuzawa} can be written as:

\begin{align}
\mathrm{LL_i} = \beta_0 A_{\mathrm{area} \; i}^{\beta_m} \mathrm{LMAs}_{i}^{\beta_s} \epsilon_{2i}\\
\end{align}

Leaf density is also known as a good predictor for LL (Kitajima,
Cordero, \& Wright, \protect\hyperlink{ref-Kitajima2013}{2013}; Kitajima
et al., \protect\hyperlink{ref-Kitajima2012}{2012}).

\begin{align}
& A_{\mathrm{area} \; i}
= \alpha_0\mathrm{LMAm}_{i}^{\alpha_m} (\mathrm{LMAs}_{i}/ \mathrm{LT}_{i})^{\alpha_s}\epsilon_{1i}\\
& \mathrm{LL_i} = \beta_0 A_{\mathrm{area} \; i}^{\beta_m} ({\mathrm{LMAs}_{i}/\mathrm{LT}_{i}})^{\beta_s} \epsilon_{2i}\\
\end{align}

where, LT\_i is leaf thickness of leaf \emph{i}, thus
\(\rm{LMAs}_i/\rm{LT}_i\) represents leaf structural density.

We fit the Optimal LL Model to the Panama data (see Methods/Datasets in
main text), which includes both sun and shade leaves for 26 out of 106
total species. We set \(\theta_{\rm L} = 1\) for sun leaves, and we fit
\(\theta_{\rm L}\) as a single free parameter assigned to all shade
leaves. We considered versions of the Optimal LL Model both with and
without an additional parameter to account for differences in LL between
the dry and wet sites due to mechanisms not included in the model (Notes
S3).

\hypertarget{datasets}{%
\subsection{Datasets}\label{datasets}}

To fit the models described above, we used LMA (g
m\textsuperscript{-2}), net photosynthetic capacity per unit leaf area
(\emph{A}\textsubscript{area}; mol s\textsuperscript{-1}
m\textsuperscript{-2}), dark respiration rate per unit leaf area
(\emph{R}\textsubscript{area}; mol s\textsuperscript{-1}
m\textsuperscript{-2}) and LL (months) from the GLOPNET global leaf
traits database (Wright et al.,
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Wright2004}{2004}) and from two tropical forest
sites in Panama: Monumental Natural Metropolitano (MNM, ``dry site'')
and Bosque Protector San Lorenzo (SL, ``wet site''). The Panama data
include leaves sampled at two canopy positions (``sun'': full sun at the
top of the canopy; and ``shade'': well shaded, sampled within 2 m of the
forest floor) from trees within reach of a canopy crane at each site.
The dry MNM site is a semi-deciduous coastal Pacific forest with a
5-month dry season from December-April and 1740 mm of annual rainfall
(Wright et al., \protect\hyperlink{ref-Wright2003}{2003}). The MNM crane
is 40 m tall with a 51 m long boom. The wet SL site is an evergreen
Caribbean coastal forest with 3100 mm of annual rainfall (Wright et al.,
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Wright2003}{2003}). The SL crane is 52 m tall
with a 54 m long boom.

After deleting leaf samples (i.e., database records, which typically
average over multiple individual leaves) that lacked one of the four
traits (LMA, \emph{A}\textsubscript{area}, \emph{R}\textsubscript{area},
or LL), 198 samples for 198 unique species were available for GLOPNET,
and 132 samples for 106 unique species were available for Panama (dry
and wet sites combined; 26 species sampled in both sun and shade; no
species with all four traits available at both sites). Both datasets
include additional traits that we used to interpret model results, but
which were not used to fit models. These traits include nitrogen and
phosphorus content per leaf unit area (\emph{N}\textsubscript{area} and
\emph{P}\textsubscript{area}; g m\textsuperscript{-2}) in both datasets,
leaf habit in GLOPNET (deciduous or evergreen), and cellulose content
per unit area (\emph{CL}\textsubscript{area}; g m\textsuperscript{-2})
in Panama.

We fit the Potential LL Model (Eq. \eqref{eq:E-LL}) to both GLOPNET and
Panama data. We fit the Optimal LL Model (Eq. \eqref{eq:optLL}; Notes S3)
only to the Panama data because GLOPNET primarily represents
interspecific variation among sun leaves, whereas the Optimal LL Model
was motivated by the negative intraspecific LL-LMA relationship observed
in Panama (Osnas et al.~in review) and elsewhere (Lusk et al.,
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Lusk2008}{2008}).

\hypertarget{parameter-estimation}{%
\subsection{Parameter estimation}\label{parameter-estimation}}

We used independent and non-informative prior distributions for all
parameters, including latent variables \emph{f\textsubscript{i}} for
each leaf sample. All priors were non-informative. The covariance matrix
in Eq.\eqref{eq:MVN} in main text was decomposed as
\({\bf \Sigma} = {\rm diag}({\bf \sigma}){\bf \Omega}{\rm diag}({\bf \sigma}) = {\rm diag}({\bf \sigma}){\bf LL}\prime {\rm diag}({\bf \sigma})\)
using a Cholesky decomposition, where \({\bf \sigma}\) is a vector of
\(\sigma_{1}\), \(\sigma_{2}\), and \(\sigma_{3}\); \({\bf \Omega}\) is
a correlation matrix of \(\rho_{12}\), \(\rho_{13}\), and \(\rho_{23}\);
and \textbf{L} is a lower triangular matrix. Instead of assigning prior
distributions on directly, priors were assigned on and \textbf{L} to
avoid a strong dependence between and (Alvarez, Niemi, \& Simpson,
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Alvarez2014}{2014}; Lewandowski, Kurowicka, \&
Joe, \protect\hyperlink{ref-Lewandowski2009}{2009}). A prior for
\textbf{L} was specified as a so-called LKJ distribution with shape
parameter 1 (Lewandowski et al.,
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Lewandowski2009}{2009}), which is identical to a
uniform distribution on the space of correlation matrices. Priors for
were specified as uniform distributions with range (0, 10,000). Priors
for \(\alpha, \beta_{1}, \beta_{2}\), \emph{r\textsubscript{p}} and
\emph{r\textsubscript{s}} in Eqs. 4-6, 8-10, and 13-14 were specified as
normal distributions with mean 0 and variance 10,000. Priors for fi in
Eqs. (2, 3, 8-10, 14), and L in Eqs. (13-14) were specified as uniform
distributions with range (0, 1).

Alternative priors for \emph{f\textsubscript{i}} were considered, but
none were presented as main results, because the alternative priors
produced statistical artifacts (Notes S4). In order to constrain the
latent variables in our model, a natural choice is to implement
hyper-parameters to describe prior means of the latent variables (e.g.,
different prior means of \emph{f\textsubscript{i}} for deciduous vs
evergreen leaves). However, analyses of simulated data suggest that
using hyper-parameters in our model results in biased inference for
\emph{f\textsubscript{i}} as well as regression parameters (Notes S4).

Models were fit using the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo algorithm (HMC)
implemented in Stan (Carpenter et al.,
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Carpenter2017}{2017}). Posterior estimates were
obtained from three independent chains of 20,000 iterations after a
burn-in of 10,000 iterations, thinning at intervals of 20. The Stan code
use to fit models are available from Github at:
\url{https://github.com/mattocci27/LMAmLMAs}. Convergence of the
posterior distribution was assessed with the Gelman-Rubin statistic with
a convergence threshold of 1.1 for all diagnostics (Gelman, Hwang, \&
Vehtari, \protect\hyperlink{ref-Gelman2014}{2014}).

\hypertarget{model-selection}{%
\subsection{Model selection}\label{model-selection}}

Alternative LL models (Eqs. \eqref{eq:E-LL} and \eqref{eq:optLL}; see also
Notes S3) fit to Panama data were compared using the WAIC
(Watanabe-Akaike information criterion) (Gelman et al.,
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Gelman2014}{2014}; Watanabe,
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Watanabe2010}{2010}). WAIC is a predictive
information criterion for Bayesian models, with lower values indicating
a more parsimonious model (Gelman et al.,
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Gelman2014}{2014}). Compared to AIC (Akaike,
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Akaike1973}{1973}) and DIC (Spiegelhalter, Best,
Carlin, \& Van Der Linde,
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Spiegelhalter2002}{2002}), WAIC has the desirable
property of averaging over the posterior distribution rather than
conditioning on a point estimate (Gelman et al.,
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Gelman2014}{2014}).

\hypertarget{variance-partitioning}{%
\subsection{Variance partitioning}\label{variance-partitioning}}

We used the following identity to estimate the relative contributions of
LMAm and LMAs to LMA variance, where again LMA = LMAm + LMAs:
\begin{align}
  {\rm Var}(Y = X1 + X2) = {\rm Cov}(Y, X1+X2) =
  {\rm Cov}(Y,X1) + {\rm Cov}(Y,X2)
  \label{eq:var}
\end{align}

Thus, the fractions of total LMA variance due to variance in LMAm and
LMAs were determined by the covariances Cov(LMA, LMAm) and Cov(LMA,
LMAs), respectively, taken as proportions of the total variance
Var(LMA). Tests with simulated data confirm that our modeling approach
can effectively partition LMA variance into LMAm and LMAs components
(Notes S4).

\hypertarget{randomized-lma-datasets}{%
\subsection{Randomized LMA datasets}\label{randomized-lma-datasets}}

Because our statistical approach includes one latent variable
\emph{f\textsubscript{i}} to partition LMA into LMAm and LMAs for each
leaf sample, one might expect a good match between predictions and
observations simply due to the large number of free parameters, whether
or not the model captured important biological mechanisms. To evaluate
model performance while controlling for the number of free parameters,
we compared the fit of our model to observed and randomized datasets.
Specifically, we generated randomized datasets by randomizing LMA values
across species, while maintaining the original (non-randomized) data for
\emph{A}\textsubscript{area}, \emph{R}\textsubscript{area} and LL. Thus,
the randomized LMA datasets had zero expected covariance between LMA and
other traits, but maintained the observed covariances among
\emph{A}\textsubscript{area}, \emph{R}\textsubscript{area} and LL. If
the fit between model and data depended primarily on the number of
parameters or other model assumptions, then we would expect similar fits
for the original (non-randomized) and randomized LMA datasets. For the
Panama dataset, which includes two sites (wet and dry) and two canopy
strata (sun and shade), we also considered constrained randomizations in
which LMA was randomized across canopy strata within each site. We
generated 10 randomized datasets for each analysis. Analyzing a larger
number of randomized datasets (e.g., 1000) was impractical given our
computationally intensive Bayesian modeling approach.

To compare model results obtained from the observed (non-randomized)
dataset to those obtained from the randomized datasets, we calculated
the standardized effect size (SES) for correlations of interest (e.g.,
between LMAm and \emph{A}\textsubscript{area}, or between LMAs and LL)
as SES = (\emph{r}\textsubscript{obs} --
\emph{r}\textsubscript{rand})/SD\textsubscript{rand}, where
\emph{r}\textsubscript{obs} is the Pearson correlation coefficient of
interest for the observed dataset, and \emph{r}\textsubscript{rand} and
SD\textsubscript{rand} are the mean and standard deviation,
respectively, of the corresponding correlation coefficients for the
randomized datasets. Under the null hypothesis of equal correlations for
the observed and randomized data, the distribution of SES is
approximately standard normal (Gotelli \& Rohde,
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Gotelli2002}{2002}), which we assumed when
calculating P-values. A significant difference (P \textless{} 0.05)
indicates that the correlation inferred from the observed dataset is
different from what would be expected to emerge from model assumptions
and free parameters.

\hypertarget{results}{%
\section{Results}\label{results}}

\textbf{1. Photosynthetic and structural LMA components (LMAm and LMAs,
respectively) can be accurately estimated.} Tests with simulated data
show that our modeling approach can accurately partition LMA into LMAm
and LMAs, except in cases where the assumed relationships (e.g., between
LMAm and Aarea, and between LMAs and LL) are weak (Notes S4). However,
tests with simulated data also show that the LMA-randomization test we
implemented can effectively diagnose these weak-correlation cases (Notes
S4). Therefore, in all cases presented below where results based on
observed data are significantly different (P \textless{} 0.05) than
results based on randomized data, we assume that estimates of LMAm and
LMAs (Eqs. \eqref{eq:LMA}-\eqref{eq:LMAs}) are accurate and that the results
reflect meaningful patterns in the data.

\textbf{2. Nearly all leaf dark respiration is associated with
photosynthetic leaf mass.} Photosynthetic mass (LMAm) accounted for
nearly all leaf dark respiration; i.e., estimated dark respiration rate
per-unit structural mass (\emph{r\textsubscript{s}}) was close to zero
in analyses of both GLOPNET and Panama data (Table S1). Thus, although
building costs are likely similar for different leaf chemical components
and tissues (Villar \& Merino, \protect\hyperlink{ref-Villar2001}{2001};
Williams, Field, \& Mooney, \protect\hyperlink{ref-Williams1989}{1989}),
our results suggest that leaf mass associated with photosynthetic
function accounts for nearly all leaf maintenance respiration.

\textbf{3. Decomposing LMA into photosynthetic and structural components
leads to improved predictions of Aarea, Rarea and LL.} For the GLOPNET
global dataset, Aarea had a strong positive correlation with LMAm, a
weak negative correlation with LMAs, and a non-significant correlation
with total LMA (Figs. 1a-c; Table S2). Aarea was also positively
correlated with LMAm in the randomized datasets (in which LMA was
randomized among leaves in GLOPNET; see gray symbols in Fig. 1), but
these correlations were weaker than those obtained from the observed
data (P \textless{} 0.001 for the null hypothesis of equal correlation
in observed and randomized datasets). Rarea in GLOPNET also had a strong
positive correlation with LMAm, which was stronger than the correlation
between Rarea and LMAm in the randomized datasets (P \textless{} 0.001),
or between Rarea and either LMA or LMAs (Figs. 1d-f). Finally, LL in
GLOPNET had a strong positive correlation with LMAs, which was stronger
than the correlation between LL and LMAs from the randomized datasets (P
\textless{} 0.001) or between LL and either LMA or LMAm (Figs. 1g-i).

For the Panama dataset, we evaluated multiple models due to the
availability of both sun and shade leaves. The Optimal LL Model
\eqref{eq:optLL} fit the data better than the Potential LL Model
\eqref{eq:E-LL} according to the Watanabe-Akaike information criterion
(WAIC; Table S1). Including site effects in the Optimal LL Model further
improved the WAIC but led to similar parameter estimates and inferences
(Table S1-3). All Panama results we report are for the Optimal LL Model
with site effects unless stated otherwise. Aarea and Rarea had stronger
and more positive correlations with LMAm than with LMA or LMAs (Figs.
2a-f and Table S3). LL was not significantly correlated with LMA when
all leaves were combined, but was strongly correlated with LMA for shade
leaves at the dry site (Fig. 2g). The correlation between LL and LMAm
was similar for observed and randomized datasets (Fig. 2h; Table S3),
implying a lack of meaningful correlation between LL and LMAm in the
Panama data. The correlation between LL and LMAs was weaker in observed
than in randomized data (Fig. 2i) because the LL vs.~LMAs relationship
ignores important factors in the Optimal LL Model (e.g., effects of
light on realized photosynthetic rates and thus optimal LL). The
correlation between predicted and observed LL was higher in the Optimal
LL Model (r = 0.81) than for randomized datasets (P \textless{} 0.001),
and also stronger than for the Potential LL Model (r = 0.38) (Fig. 3;
Table S4).

\textbf{4. Most interspecific LMA variation is due to variation in
structural leaf mass, not photosynthetic leaf mass.} LMAs accounted for
the majority of interspecific variation in LMA among all leaves in
GLOPNET (74.7\%), among sun leaves in Panama (57.8\%), and among shade
leaves in Panama (86.0\%) (Fig. 4).

\textbf{5. Evergreen leaves have greater LMAs than deciduous leaves, and
sun leaves have both greater LMAm and LMAs than shade leaves.} In the
GLOPNET dataset, evergreen leaves had significantly higher LMAs than
deciduous leaves, but the two groups had similar LMAm (Fig. 5). Thus,
the higher total LMA in evergreen leaves in GLOPNET was primarily due to
differences in LMAs (which comprised a greater fraction of LMA in
evergreen than in deciduous leaves; Fig. S1a). Similar results were
obtained for the Panama dataset (evergreen leaves have higher LMAs but
similar LMAm compared to deciduous leaves; Fig. S1b). In the Panama
dataset, both LMAm and LMAs were significantly higher in sun leaves than
in shade leaves (Fig. 5). Thus, in contrast to interspecific variation
in LMA (which is primarily driven by variation in LMAs; Fig. 4),
intraspecific variation in LMA reflects changes in both LMAs and LMAm.

\textbf{6. Nitrogen and phosphorus per-unit leaf area are strongly
correlated with LMAm, and cellulose per-unit leaf area is strongly
correlated with LMAs.} In the GLOPNET dataset,
\emph{N}\textsubscript{area} and \emph{P}\textsubscript{area} had strong
positive correlations with LMAm, but only weak correlations with LMAs
(Fig. S3). Similarly, in the Panama dataset,
\emph{N}\textsubscript{area} and \emph{P}\textsubscript{area} had strong
positive correlations with LMAm, but were not correlated with LMAs (Fig.
6). In contrast, cellulose per-unit leaf area
(\emph{CL}\textsubscript{area}), which was available for the Panama
dataset but not for GLOPNET, had a strong positive correlation with
LMAs, and a weak positive correlation with LMAm (Fig. 6).
\emph{CL}\textsubscript{area} was more strongly correlated with LMA than
with LMAm or LMAs, but sun and shade leaves aligned along a common
\emph{CL}\textsubscript{area}-LMAs relationship, as opposed to being
offset for LMA and LMAm (Figs. 6g-i). The above correlations
(\emph{N}\textsubscript{area} and \emph{P}\textsubscript{area} with
LMAm, and \emph{CL}\textsubscript{area} with LMAs) were stronger than
those based on randomized datasets (P \textless{} 0.001 in all cases,
Fig. 6 and Fig. S3).

\hypertarget{discussion}{%
\section{Discussion}\label{discussion}}

Our analyses demonstrate that decomposing LMA variation into separate
photosynthetic and structural components (LMAm and LMAs, respectively)
leads to improved predictions of photosynthetic capacity
(\emph{A}\textsubscript{max}), dark respiration rate
(\emph{R}\textsubscript{dark}), and leaf lifespan (LL), as well as clear
relationships with traits used for independent model evaluation
(nitrogen, phosphorus, and cellulose concentrations). Tests with
simulated data suggest that our results are robust and reflect
meaningful, previously unreported patterns in leaf trait data. Below, we
elaborate on the insights gained from our analysis and the implications
of our results for the representation of leaf functional diversity in
global ecosystem models.

Decomposing LMA into LMAm and LMAs provides insights into why
interspecific variation in leaf traits related to photosynthesis and
metabolism are primarily area-dependent (i.e., primarily independent of
LMA when expressed per-unit area) rather than mass-dependent (see Notes
S1-2 and Osnas et al.~2013 for explanation of trait mass-
vs.~area-dependence). Specifically, our results suggest that most
interspecific LMA variation across the global flora and across tropical
tree species in Panama is due to variation in leaf mass components that
contribute to LL but not to \emph{A}\textsubscript{max} (Fig. 4). An
illustrative case is the comparison of evergreen and deciduous leaves in
the global flora: according to our model results, evergreen leaves have
greater LMAs (and thus greater LL) but similar LMAm (and thus similar
Aarea) compared to deciduous leaves (Figs. 1 and 5). This comparison
illustrates why interspecific LMA variation is largely unrelated to
area-based \emph{A}\textsubscript{max}, which in turn explains trait
area-dependence (Notes S1-2). Consistent with this explanation, the
assemblage we examined where LMAs accounted for the highest fraction of
total LMA variation (86\% for Panama shade leaves; Fig. 4) is also the
assemblage with the highest degree of trait area-dependence (Osnas et
al.~in review).

Decomposing LMA also provides insights as to why intraspecific patterns
of trait variation differ from those observed across species. In
contrast to interspecific LMA variation, our analysis suggests that LMAm
contributes half or more of the intraspecific increase in LMA from shade
to sun (Figs. 5 and S1). The increase in LMAm from shade to sun -- which
likely reflects an increase in the size and number of palisade mesophyll
cells with increasing light availability (Onoda, Schieving, \& Anten,
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Onoda2008}{2008}; Terashima, Hanba, Tholen, \&
Niinemets, \protect\hyperlink{ref-Terashima2011}{2011}) -- is also
associated with an increase in LMAs from shade to sun (Fig. 5). This
positive covariance between LMAm and LMAs within species means that
per-area values of LMAm-dependent traits (e.g.,
\emph{A}\textsubscript{area}) have a strong, positive relationship with
total LMA, which implies trait mass-dependence (Notes S1-2). In
contrast, because interspecific variation in LMA is due primarily to
variation in LMAs rather than LMAm, LMAm-dependent traits (when
expressed per-unit area) are largely independent of LMA across species,
which implies trait area-dependence (Notes S1-2).

Finally, decomposing LMA provides insights into the intraspecific LL
`counter-gradient' (Lusk et al., \protect\hyperlink{ref-Lusk2008}{2008};
Osada et al., \protect\hyperlink{ref-Osada2001}{2001}; Russo \&
Kitajima, \protect\hyperlink{ref-Russo2016}{2016}), whereby LL decreases
as LMA increases from shade to sun within species, which contrasts with
positive interspecific LL-LMA relationships within a single light
environment. Decomposing LMA into LMAm and LMAs suggests that the
decline in photosynthetic rate from sun to shade (which increases
optimal LL from a carbon-gain perspective; Kikuzawa
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Kikuzawa1991}{1991})) is sufficient to produce
an intraspecific counter-gradient, because a counter-gradient occurs at
the dry Panama site (6 vs.~8 months for sun vs.~shade LL means) despite
no change in the structural leaf mass fraction (LMAs/LMA) from sun to
shade (see LMAm/LMA values in Fig. S1c, with LMAs/LMA = 1 -- LMAm/LMA).
However, the counter-gradient is stronger at the wet Panama site (11
vs.~31 months for sun vs.~shade LL means), where LMAs/LMA is
significantly higher for shade leaves than for sun leaves (see LMAm/LMA
in Fig. S1c). Thus, at the wet Panama site, changes in LMAs/LMA from sun
to shade appear to strengthen the counter-gradient. The potential for
LMAs/LMA to enhance the counter-gradient is corroborated by data on
cellulose percent mass, which is similar in shade and sun at the Panama
dry site (Fig. S4b; as observed by Lusk, Onoda, Kooyman, \&
Gutiérrez-Girón (\protect\hyperlink{ref-Lusk2010}{2010})), but higher in
shade than sun at the wet site (Fig. S4b; as observed by Kitajima,
Wright, \& Westbrook (\protect\hyperlink{ref-Kitajima2016}{2016})). In
summary, the decrease in optimal LL with increasing light (Kikuzawa,
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Kikuzawa1991}{1991}) appears sufficient by itself
to create a LL counter-gradient, but the counter-gradient appears to be
enhanced in some assemblages by greater structural mass fractions in
shade vs.~sun leaves.

The improved predictions and understanding provided by decomposing LMA
into photosynthetic and structural components challenge the view that
leaf functional diversity can be accurately represented by a single leaf
economics spectrum (LES) axis (I. J. Wright et al.,
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Wright2004a}{2004}). Lloyd et al.
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Lloyd2013}{2013}) argued that the apparent
dominance of a single LES axis is an artifact of expressing
area-dependent leaf traits on a per-mass basis, and Osnas et al.
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Osnas2013}{2013}) demonstrated that across the
global flora, traits related to photosynthesis and metabolism are indeed
area-dependent. Intraspecific patterns in trait variation, which
contrast with interspecific patterns, pose additional challenges for a
one-dimensional view of leaf functional diversity. Our analysis shows
that considering two primary axes of leaf trait variation
(photosynthesis and structure) provides improved quantitative
predictions and insights compared to a single LES. Our results point to
a simple two-dimensional framework for representing leaf functional
diversity in global ecosystem models: a LMAm axis that determines
\emph{A}\textsubscript{max}, accounts for nearly all
\emph{R}\textsubscript{dark} (see rp and rs estimates in Table S1), and
affects LL as predicted by optimality theory (Kikuzawa 1991); and a LMAs
axis that determines potential LL through its effects on leaf toughness
(Kitajima et al., \protect\hyperlink{ref-Kitajima2012}{2012}). In the
datasets we analyzed (the global flora and tropical trees in Panama),
these two axes are only weakly correlated with each other (Fig. S5),
which suggests that trait-based approaches to global ecosystem modeling
(Scheiter, Langan, \& Higgins,
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Scheiter2013}{2013}; Wullschleger et al.,
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Wullschleger2014}{2014}) could consider these as
independent axes.

Our statistical decomposition of LMA into photosynthetic and structural
components provides important insights (summarized above), but
additional insights and accuracy could be gained by a more mechanistic
modeling approach. For example, John et al.
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-John2017}{2017}) decomposed interspecific LMA
variation into anatomical components such as the size, number of layers,
and mass density of cells in different leaf tissues. If such detailed
information became available for a large number of leaves, representing
both intra- and interspecific variation, it should be possible to
quantify how these anatomical traits scale up to leaf-level
\emph{A}\textsubscript{max} , \emph{R}\textsubscript{dark}, and LL. A
simpler alternative would be to modify our model (see methods) to
account for variation in cell wall thickness (TCW): for a given cell
size, increasing TCW would lead to an increase in lamina density,
cellulose per volume, toughness, and LL (Kitajima et al.,
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Kitajima2012}{2012},
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Kitajima2016}{2016}; Kitajima \& Poorter,
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Kitajima2010}{2010}), and a decrease in mesophyll
conductance and \emph{A}\textsubscript{max} (Evans, McGuire, Brown,
Andayani, \& Supriatna, \protect\hyperlink{ref-Evans2008}{2008}; Onoda
et al., \protect\hyperlink{ref-Onoda2017}{2017}; Terashima et al.,
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Terashima2011}{2011}).

\hypertarget{conclusions}{%
\section{Conclusions}\label{conclusions}}

It is widely recognized that LMA variation is associated with multiple
tissues and functions, including metabolically active mesophyll that
largely determines photosynthetic capacity, as well as structural and
chemical components that contribute primarily to leaf toughness and
defense (Lusk et al., \protect\hyperlink{ref-Lusk2010}{2010}; Roderick,
Berry, Noble, \& Farquhar, \protect\hyperlink{ref-Roderick1999}{1999};
Shipley et al., \protect\hyperlink{ref-Shipley2006}{2006}). It should
not be surprising then, that partitioning LMA into photosynthetic and
structural components yields enhanced predictions and improved
understanding of patterns of leaf trait variation both within and among
species. Yet for over a decade, the vast literature on leaf traits has
been strongly influenced by the view that leaf trait variation can
usefully be represented by a single LES axis. Our results provide
quantitative evidence that this one-dimensional view of leaf trait
variation is insufficient, and our model provides a biological
explanation for previous statistical analyses that have demonstrated
area-dependence of leaf traits across species (Osnas et al.,
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Osnas2013}{2013}), while also explaining
mass-dependence within species. Our results suggest that most of the
interspecific variation in LMA concerns structural mass that contributes
to LL but not to photosynthetic capacity, and that structural and
photosynthetic LMA components are only weakly correlated across species.
Thus, strong interspecific correlations between LMA and mass-normalized
photosynthetic capacity (and related traits, such as respiration rate,
and nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations) are likely driven by
mass-normalization itself, rather than any functional dependence of
these photosynthetic and metabolic traits on LMA (Lloyd et al.,
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Lloyd2013}{2013}; Osnas et al.,
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Osnas2013}{2013}). In contrast, intraspecific
variation in LMA is driven by coordinated changes in structural and
photosynthetic mass components, which explains why mass-normalized
photosynthetic and metabolic traits vary little from sun to shade within
species (Aranda, Pardo, Gil, \& Pardos,
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Aranda2004}{2004}; Niinemets et al.,
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Niinemets2015}{2015}; Poorter et al.,
