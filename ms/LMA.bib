  abstract = {Satellite and tower-based metrics of forest-scale photosynthesis generally increase with dry season progression across central Amaz\^onia, but the underlying mechanisms lack consensus. We conducted demographic surveys of leaf age composition, and measured the age dependence of leaf physiology in broadleaf canopy trees of abundant species at a central eastern Amazon site. Using a novel leaf-to-branch scaling approach, we used these data to independently test the much-debated hypothesis \textendash{} arising from satellite and tower-based observations \textendash{} that leaf phenology could explain the forest-scale pattern of dry season photosynthesis. Stomatal conductance and biochemical parameters of photosynthesis were higher for recently mature leaves than for old leaves. Most branches had multiple leaf age categories simultaneously present, and the number of recently mature leaves increased as the dry season progressed because old leaves were exchanged for new leaves. These findings provide the first direct field evidence that branch-scale photosynthetic capacity increases during the dry season, with a magnitude consistent with increases in ecosystem-scale photosynthetic capacity derived from flux towers. Interactions between leaf age-dependent physiology and shifting leaf age-demographic composition are sufficient to explain the dry season photosynthetic capacity pattern at this site, and should be considered in vegetation models of tropical evergreen forests.},

  abstract = {Covariance matrix estimation arises in multivariate problems including multivariate normal sampling models and regression models where random effects are jointly modeled, e.g. random-intercept, random-slope models. A Bayesian analysis of these problems requires a prior on the covariance matrix. Here we assess, through a simulation study and a real data set, the impact this prior choice has on posterior inference of the covariance matrix. Inverse Wishart distribution is the natural choice for a covariance matrix prior because its conjugacy on normal model and simplicity, is usually available in Bayesian statistical software. However inverse Wishart distribution presents some undesirable properties from a modeling point of view. It can be too restrictive because assume the same amount of prior information about every variance parameters and, more important, it shows a prior relationship between the variances and correlations. Some alternatives distributions has been proposed. The scaled inverse Wishart distribution, which give more flexibility on the variance priors conserving the conjugacy property but does not eliminate the prior relationship between variances and correlations. Secondly, it is possible to fit separate priors for individual correlations and standard deviations. This strategy eliminates any prior relationship within the covariance matrix parameters, but it is not conjugate and therefore computationally slow.},

  abstract = {Changes in leaf mass per area (LMA), nitrogen content on a mass-basis (Nm) and on an area basis (Na) with relative irradiance were assessed in leaves of eight temperate species harvested at different depths in a canopy. Relative irradiance (GSF) at the points of leaf sampling was estimated by hemispheric photographs. There was a strong species-dependent positive relationship between LMA and GSF for all species. Shade-tolerant species such as Fagus sylvatica showed lower LMA for the same GSF than less tolerant species as Quercus pyrenaica or Quercus petraea. The only evergreen species in the study, Ilex aquifollium, had the highest LMA, independent of light environment, with minimum values much higher than the rest of the broad-leaved species studied. There was no relation between Nm and GSF for most species studied and only a very weak relation for the relative shade-intolerant species Q. pyrenaica. Within each species, the pattern of Na investment with regard to GSF was linked mainly to LMA. At the same relative irradiance, differences in Na among species were conditioned both by the LMA-GSF relationship and by the species Nm value. The lowest Nm value was measured in I. aquifollium (14.3 {$\pm$} 0.6 mg g-1); intermediate values in Crataegus monogyna (16.9 {$\pm$} 0.6 mg g-1) and Prunus avium (19.1 {$\pm$} 0.6 mg g -1) and higher values, all in a narrow range (21.3 {$\pm$} 0.6 to 23 {$\pm$} 0.6 mg g-1), were measured for the other five species. Changes in LMA with the relative irradiance were linked both to lamina thickness (LT) and to palisade/spongy parenchyma ratio (PP/SP). In the second case, the LMA changes may be related to an increase in lamina density as palisade parenchyma involves higher cell packing than spongy parenchyma. However, since PP/SP ratio showed a weak species-specific relationship with LMA, the increase in LT should be the main cause of LMA variation. \textcopyright{} 2004 Elsevier SAS.

Here, we develop a comprehensive framework for the origin of this leaf economics spectrum based on venation-mediated economic strategies. We define a standardized set of traits - density, distance and loopiness - that provides a common language for the study of venation. We develop a novel quantitative model that uses these venation traits to model leaf-level physiology, and show that selection to optimize the venation network predicts the mean global trait-trait scaling relationships across 2548 species. Furthermore, using empirical venation data for 25 plant species, we test our model by predicting four key leaf functional traits related to leaf economics: net carbon assimilation rate, life span, leaf mass per area ratio and nitrogen content. Together, these results indicate that selection on venation geometry is a fundamental basis for understanding the diversity of leaf form and function, and the carbon balance of leaves. The model and associated predictions have broad implications for integrating venation network geometry with pattern and process in ecophysiology, ecology and palaeobotany.},

  abstract = {[1] While most land models developed for use with climate models represent vegetation as discrete biomes, this is, at least for mixed life-form biomes, inconsistent with the leaf-level and whole-plant physiological parameterizations needed to couple these biogeophysical models with biogeochemical and ecosystem dynamics models. In this paper, we present simulations with the National Center for Atmospheric Research land surface model (NCAR LSM) that examined the effect of representing vegetation as patches of plant functional types (PFTs) that coexist within a model grid cell. This approach is consistent with ecological theory and models and allows for unified treatment of vegetation in climate and ecosystem models. In the standard NCAR LSM the PFT composition and leaf area for each grid cell are obtained by classifying grid cells as 1 of 28 possible biomes. Here, we develop a data set from 1-km satellite data that provides each model grid cell a unique PFT composition and leaf area for each PFT. Global simulations at 3degrees x 3degrees spatial resolution showed that ground temperature, ground evaporation, and northern high-latitude winter albedo exhibited direct responses to these landscape changes, which led to indirect effects such as in soil moisture and sensible and latent heat fluxes. Additional simulations at 2degrees x 2degrees and 1degrees x 1degrees spatial resolution showed that low-resolution simulations masked landscape heterogeneity in both approaches but the satellite-based, continuous representation of vegetation reduced model sensitivity to resolution. It is argued that the use of spatially continuous distributions of coexisting PFTs is a necessary step to link climate and ecosystem models.},

Traditional statistical inference can then be based on this selected best model. However, we now emphasize that information-theoretic approaches allow formal inference to be based on more than one model (m- timodel inference). Such procedures lead to more robust inferences in many cases, and we advocate these approaches throughout the book. The second edition was prepared with three goals in mind. First, we have tried to improve the presentation of the material. Boxes now highlight ess- tial expressions and points. Some reorganization has been done to improve the ?ow of concepts, and a new chapter has been added. Chapters 2 and 4 have been streamlined in view of the detailed theory provided in Chapter 7. S- ond, concepts related to making formal inferences from more than one model (multimodel inference) have been emphasized throughout the book, but p- ticularly in Chapters 4, 5, and 6. Third, new technical material has been added to Chapters 5 and 6. Well over 100 new references to the technical literature are given. These changes result primarily from our experiences while giving several seminars, workshops, and graduate courses on material in the ?rst e- tion.},

A Stan program imperatively defines a log probability function over parameters conditioned on specified data and constants. As of version 2.14.0, Stan provides full Bayesian inference for continuous-variable models through Markov chain Monte Carlo methods such as the No-U-Turn sampler, an adaptive form of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling. Penalized maximum likelihood estimates are calculated using optimization methods such as the limited memory Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno algorithm. Stan is also a platform for computing log densities and their gradients and Hessians, which can be used in alternative algorithms such as variational Bayes, expectation propagation, and marginal inference using approximate integration. To this end, Stan is set up so that the densities, gradients, and Hessians, along with intermediate quantities of the algorithm such as acceptance probabilities, are easily accessible. Stan can be called from the command line using the cmdstan package, through R using the rstan package, and through Python using the pystan package. All three interfaces support sampling and optimization-based inference with diagnostics and posterior analysis. rstan and pystan also provide access to log probabilities, gradients, Hessians, parameter transforms, and specialized plotting.},

A simple, general rule that accurately described this down-regulation would improve carbon cycle models and enhance our understanding of how forest successional diversity is maintained. In this paper, we investigated the light response of Amax and Rdark for saplings of six temperate forest tree species in New Jersey, USA, and formulated a simple model of down-regulation that could be incorporated into carbon cycle models. We found that full-sun values of Amax and Rdark differed significantly among species, but the rate of down-regulation (proportional decrease in Amax or Rdark relative to the full-sun value) in response to shade was not significantly species- or taxon-specific. Shade leaves of sun-grown plants appear to follow the same pattern of down-regulation in response to shade as leaves of shade-grown plants. Given the light level above a leaf and one species-specific number (either the full-sun Amax or full-sun Rdark), we provide a formula that can accurately predict the leaf's Amax and Rdark. We further show that most of the down regulation of per unit area Rdark and Amax is caused by reductions in leaf mass per unit area (LMA): as light decreases, leaves get thinner, while per unit mass Amax and Rdark remain approximately constant.},

We estimated intraspecific variation in leaf functional traits related to the primary metabolism and anti-herbivore defence in a population of Turnera velutina. We analysed whether natural selection favoured the expression of individual traits, particular combinations of traits or leaf phenotypic integration. Patterns of covariation among traits were related to water and nitrogen economy, and were similar among genotypes, but the magnitude of their phenotypic integration differed by 10-fold. Although families did not differ in the mean values of leaf functional traits, directional selection favoured low nitrogen content and low chemical defence, high content of chlorophyll, sugar in extrafloral nectar and trichome density. Families with higher phenotypic integration among leaf traits grew faster and produced more flowers. We suggest that the coordinated expression of leaf traits has an adaptive value, probably related to optimisation in the expression of traits related to water conservation and nitrogen acquisition.},

Leaf area, the leaf economics spectrum (indexed by LMA and Narea) and {$\chi$} (from stable carbon isotope ratios) varied almost independently among species. Across sites, however, {$\chi$} and LA increased with mean growing-season temperature (mGDD0) and decreased with vapour pressure deficit (mVPD0) and soil pH. LMA and Narea showed the reverse pattern. Climate responses agreed with expectations based on optimality principles.

  abstract = {CO(2) faces a series of resistances while diffusing between the substomatal cavities and the sites of carboxylation within chloroplasts. The absence of techniques to measure the resistance of individual steps makes it difficult to define their relative importance. Resistance to diffusion through intercellular airspace differs between leaves, but is usually of minor importance. Leaves with high photosynthetic capacity per unit leaf area reduce mesophyll resistance by increasing the surface area of chloroplasts exposed to intercellular airspace per unit leaf area, S(c). Cell walls impose a significant resistance. Assuming an effective porosity of the cell wall of 0.1 or 0.05, then cell walls could account for 25\% or 50\% of the total mesophyll resistance, respectively. Since the fraction of apoplastic water that is unbound and available for unhindered CO(2) diffusion is unknown, it is possible that the effective porosity is {$<$}0.05. Effective porosity could also vary in response to changes in pH or cation concentration. Consequently, cell walls could account for {$>$}50\% of the total resistance and a variable proportion. Most of the remaining resistance is imposed by one or more of the three membranes as mesophyll resistance can be altered by varying the expression of cooporins. The CO(2) permeability of vesicles prepared from chloroplast envelopes has been reduced by RNA interference (RNAi) expression of NtAQP1, but not those prepared from the plasma membrane. Carbonic anhydrase activity also influences mesophyll resistance. Mesophyll resistance is relatively insensitive to the manipulation of any step in the pathway because it represents only part of the total and may also be countered by pleiotropic compensatory changes. The parameters in greatest need of additional measurements are S(c), mesophyll cell wall thickness, and the permeabilities of the plasma membrane and chloroplast envelope.},

We use an example to illustrate serious problems with the inverse-gamma family of "noninformative" prior distributions. We suggest instead to use a uniform prior on the hierarchical standard deviation, using the half-t family when the number of groups is small and in other settings where a weakly informative prior is desired. We also illustrate the use of the half-t family for hierarchical modeling of multiple variance parameters such as arise in the analysis of variance.},

  abstract = {We propose a new prior distribution for classical (nonhierarchical) logistic regression models, constructed by first scaling all nonbinary variables to have mean 0 and standard deviation 0.5, and then placing independent Student-\$t\$ prior distributions on the coefficients. As a default choice, we recommend the Cauchy distribution with center 0 and scale 2.5, which in the simplest setting is a longer-tailed version of the distribution attained by assuming one-half additional success and one-half additional failure in a logistic regression. Cross-validation on a corpus of datasets shows the Cauchy class of prior distributions to outperform existing implementations of Gaussian and Laplace priors. We recommend this prior distribution as a default choice for routine applied use. It has the advantage of always giving answers, even when there is complete separation in logistic regression (a common problem, even when the sample size is large and the number of predictors is small), and also automatically applying more shrinkage to higher-order interactions. This can be useful in routine data analysis as well as in automated procedures such as chained equations for missing-data imputation. We implement a procedure to fit generalized linear models in R with the Student-\$t\$ prior distribution by incorporating an approximate EM algorithm into the usual iteratively weighted least squares. We illustrate with several applications, including a series of logistic regressions predicting voting preferences, a small bioassay experiment, and an imputation model for a public health data set.},

  title = {The Prior Can Often Only Be Understood in the Context of the Likelihood *},
  author = {Gelman, Andrew and Simpson, Daniel and Betancourt, Michael},
  year = {2017},
  abstract = {A key sticking point of Bayesian analysis is the choice of prior distribution, and there is a vast literature on potential defaults including uniform priors, Jeffreys' priors, reference priors , maximum entropy priors, and weakly informative priors. These methods, however, often manifest a key conceptual tension in prior modeling: a model encoding true prior information should be chosen without reference to the model of the measurement process, but almost all common prior modeling techniques are implicitly motivated by a reference likelihood. In this paper we resolve this apparent paradox by placing the choice of prior into the context of the entire Bayesian analysis, from inference to prediction to model evaluation. 1. The role of the prior distribution in a Bayesian analysis Both in theory and in practice, the prior distribution can play many roles in a Bayesian analysis. Perhaps most formally the prior serves to encode information germane to the problem being analyzed , but in practice it often becomes a means of stabilizing inferences in complex, high-dimensional problems. In other settings the prior is treated as little more than a nuisance, serving simply as a catalyst for the expression of uncertainty via Bayes' theorem. These different roles often motivate a distinction between "subjective" and "objective" choices of priors, but we are unconvinced of the relevance of this distinction (Gelman and Hennig, 2017). We prefer to characterize Bayesian priors, and statistical models more generally, based on the information they include rather than the philosophical interpretation of that information. The ultimate significance of this information, and hence the prior itself, depends on exactly how that information manifests in the final analysis. Consequently the influence of the prior can only be judged within the context of the likelihood. In the present paper we address an apparent paradox: Logically, the prior distribution should come before the data model, but in practice, priors are often chosen with reference to a likelihood function. We resolve this puzzle in two ways, first with a robustness argument, recognizing that our models are only approximate, and in particular the relevance to any given data analysis of particular assumptions in the prior distribution depends on the likelihood; and, second, by considering the different roles that the prior plays in different Bayesian analyses. One can roughly speak of two sorts of Bayesian analyses. In the first sort, the Bayesian formalism can be taken literally: a researcher starts with a prior distribution about some externally defined quantity, perhaps some physical parameter or the effect of some social intervention, and then he or she analyzes data,},

In principle, higher mechanical resistance achieved via higher relative allocation to cell walls should slow photosynthetic rates. However, interspecific relationships among these two leaf functions have not been reported. We measured leaf traits of 57 dominant woody species in a subtropical evergreen forest in China, focusing especially on photosynthetic rates, mechanical properties, and leaf lifespan (LLS). These species were assigned to two ecological strategy groups: shade-tolerant species and light-demanding species. On average, shade-tolerant species had longer LLS, higher leaf mechanical strength but lower photosynthetic rates, and exhibited longer LLS for a given leaf mass per area (LMA) or mechanical strength than light-demanding species. Depending on the traits and the basis of expression (per area or per mass), leaf mechanical resistance and photosynthetic capacity were either deemed unrelated, or only weakly negatively correlated. We found only weak support for the proposed trade-off between leaf biomechanics and photosynthesis among co-occurring woody species. This suggests there is considerable flexibility in these properties, and the observed relationships may result more so from trait coordination than any physically or physiologically enforced trade-off.},

  abstract = {Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) is a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm that avoids the random walk behavior and sensitivity to correlated parameters that plague many MCMC methods by taking a series of steps informed by first-order gradient information. These features allow it to converge to high-dimensional target distributions much more quickly than simpler methods such as random walk Metropolis or Gibbs sampling. However, HMC's performance is highly sensitive to two user-specified parameters: a step size \{\textbackslash epsilon\} and a desired number of steps L. In particular, if L is too small then the algorithm exhibits undesirable random walk behavior, while if L is too large the algorithm wastes computation. We introduce the No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS), an extension to HMC that eliminates the need to set a number of steps L. NUTS uses a recursive algorithm to build a set of likely candidate points that spans a wide swath of the target distribution, stopping automatically when it starts to double back and retrace its steps. Empirically, NUTS perform at least as efficiently as and sometimes more efficiently than a well tuned standard HMC method, without requiring user intervention or costly tuning runs. We also derive a method for adapting the step size parameter \{\textbackslash epsilon\} on the fly based on primal-dual averaging. NUTS can thus be used with no hand-tuning at all. NUTS is also suitable for applications such as BUGS-style automatic inference engines that require efficient "turnkey" sampling algorithms.},

Here we show the global implications of these parameterisations with a global gridded land model. This model aggregates Rd to whole-plant respiration Rp, driven with meteorological forcings spanning uncertainty across climate change models. For pre-industrial estimates, new baseline Rd increases Rp and especially in the tropics. Compared to new baseline, revised instantaneous response decreases Rp for mid-latitudes, while acclimation lowers this for the tropics with increases elsewhere. Under global warming, new Rd estimates amplify modelled respiration increases, although partially lowered by acclimation. Future measurements will refine how Rd aggregates to whole-plant respiration. Our analysis suggests Rp could be around~30\% higher than existing estimates.},

To test the utility of this framework for understanding hydraulic traits, drought physiology and recovery, we applied a 6 wk experimental soil moisture reduction to seven tree species followed by a 6 wk recovery period. Throughout, we measured hydraulic traits and monitored changes in gas exchange, leaf water potential, and hydraulic conductivity. Species' hydraulic traits were not coordinated, as some anisohydric species had surprisingly low resistance to embolism (P50) and negative safety margins. In addition to widespread hydraulic damage, these species also experienced reductions in photosynthesis and stem water potential during water stress, and delayed recovery time. Given that we observed no benefit of being anisohydric either during or after drought, our results indicate the need to reconsider the traits and tradeoffs that underlie anisohydric behavior, and to consider the environmental, biological and edaphic processes that could allow this strategy to flourish in forests.},

The percentages of evergreenness decrease with decreasing favorable-period length and reach the minimum at an intermediate length of the favorable period but increase again with a decrease in the length of the favorable period.

The light-saturated CO 2 exchange rates of leaves produced during the primary annual leaf flush measured at 7\textendash 8 mo of age were 33\textendash 65\% of the rates measured at 1\textendash 2 mo of age for species with leaf life span of Ͻ 1 yr.

Maximum oxygen evolution rates and leaf nitrogen content declined faster with age for species with shorter leaf life spans. Statistical significance of regression slopes of oxygen evolution rates against leaf age was strongest on a leaf mass basis (r 2 ϭ 0.49\textendash 0.87), followed by leaf nitrogen basis (r 2 ϭ 0.48\textendash 0.77), and weakest on a leaf area basis (r 2 ϭ 0.35\textendash 0.70). Rates of photosynthesis after the full expansion of a leaf generally exhibit a monotonic decline (Sestak et al., 1985). This decline is caused by a redistribution of re-sources to younger leaves for optimization of the whole-shoot photosynthetic income, rather than by an uncon-trolled deterioration (Field and Mooney, 1983; Hikosaka, Terashima, and Katoh, 1994). In a diverse range of plant species including tropical trees (Zotz and Winter, 1994; Ackerly and Bazzaz, 1995), it has been observed that leaf nitrogen content and photosynthetic capacity decrease linearly with leaf age. Consideration of the effect of leaf age on photosynthetic capacity is necessary in order to estimate the long-term carbon budget of a leaf and of the whole canopy. One approach to incorporate the effect of leaf age on estimation of carbon income is to repeat diel measurements of photosynthetic rates throughout the life-time of a leaf (Zotz and Winter, 1994). Although this is perhaps the most rigorous approach for a single leaf, it is time-consuming and the results are difficult to param-eterize for a population of leaves, especially when there is significant variation among leaves. Since daily net pho-tosynthetic gain is tightly correlated with photosynthetic capacity (Zotz and Winter, 1994), if we can approximate the function of decreasing photosynthetic capacity with leaf age, it greatly facilitates modeling long-term carbon budgets for the whole canopy. A simple approximation of this monotonic decrease 1 Manuscript},

  abstract = {The effect of leaf age on photosynthetic capacity, a critical parameter in the theory of optimal leaf longevity, was studied for two tropical pioneer tree species, Cecropia longipes and Urera caracasana, in a seasonally dry forest in Panama. These species continuously produce short-lived leaves (74 and 93 d, respectively) during the rainy season (May-December) on orthotropic branches. However, they differ in leaf production rate, maximum number of leaves per branch, light environment experienced by the leaves, leaf mass per unit area, and nitrogen content. Light-saturated photosynthetic rates for marked leaves of known ages ({$\pm$}1 wk) were measured with two contrasting schemes (repeated measurements vs. chronosequence within branch), which overall produced similar results. In both species, photosynthetic rates and nitrogen use efficiency were negatively correlated with leaf age and positively correlated with light availability. Photosynthetic rates declined faster with leaf age in Cecropia than in Urera as predicted by the theory. The rate of decline was faster for leaves on branches with faster leaf turnover rates. Nitrogen per unit leaf area decreased with leaf age only for Urera. Leaf mass per unit area increased with leaf age, either partly (in Cecropia) or entirely (in Urera) due to ash accumulation.},

Species with higher RGR in sun also had higher RGR in shade. These interspecific trends could be explained by differences in morphological traits and allocation patterns among species. Within each light regime, seedlings of shade-intolerant species had lower root: shoot ratios, higher leaf mass per unit area, and higher leaf area ratios (LAR) than shade tolerant species. In contrast, leaf gas exchange characteristics, or acclimation potential in these traits, had no relationship with seedling mortality rates in shade. In both shade tolerant and intolerant species, light saturated photosynthesis rates, dark respiration, and light compensation points were higher for sun-grown seedlings than far shade-grown seedlings. Differences in R:FR ratio in shade did not affect gas exchange, allocation patterns, or growth rates of any species. Survival of young tree seedlings in shade did not depend on higher net photosynthesis or biomass accumulation rates in shade. Rather, species with higher RGR died faster in shade than species with lower RGR. This trend could be explained if survival depends on morphological charac teristics likely to enhance defense against herbivores and pathogens, such as dense and tough leaves, a well-established root system, and high wood density. High construction costs for these traits, and low LAR as a consequence of these traits, should result in lower rates of whole-plant carbon gain and RGR for shade tolerant species than shade-intolerant species in shade as well as in sun.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Leaf life span is widely recognized as a key life history trait associated with herbivory resistance, but rigorous comparative data are rare for seedlings. The goal of this study was to examine how light environment affects leaf life span, and how ontogenetic development during the first year may influence leaf fracture toughness, lamina density and stem density that are relevant for herbivory resistance, leaf life span and seedling survival.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nMETHODS: Data from three experiments encompassing 104 neotropical woody species were combined. Leaf life span, lamina and vein fracture toughness, leaf and stem tissue density and seedling survival were quantified for the first-year seedlings at standardized ontogenetic stages in shade houses and common gardens established in gaps and shaded understorey in a moist tropical forest in Panama. Mortality of naturally recruited seedlings till 1 year later was quantified in 800 1-m{$^2$} plots from 1994 to 2011.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nKEY RESULTS: Median leaf life span ranged widely among species, always greater in shade (ranging from 151 to {$>$}1790 d in the understorey and shade houses) than in gaps (115-867 d), but with strong correlation between gaps and shade. Leaf and stem tissue density increased with seedling age, whereas leaf fracture toughness showed only a weak increase. All these traits were positively correlated with leaf life span. Leaf life span and stem density were negatively correlated with seedling mortality in shade, while gap mortality showed no correlation with these traits.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nCONCLUSIONS: The wide spectrum of leaf life span and associated functional traits reflects variation in shade tolerance of first-year seedlings among coexisting trees, shrubs and lianas in this neotropical forest. High leaf tissue density is important in enhancing leaf toughness, a known physical defence, and leaf life span. Both seedling leaf life span and stem density should be considered as key functional traits that contribute to seedling survival in tropical forest understoreys.},

  abstract = {Leaves as the main photosynthetic organ of plants must be well protected against various hazards to achieve their optimal lifespans. Yet, within-species variation and the material basis of leaf strength have been explored for very few species. Here, we present a large dataset of leaf fracture toughness from a species-rich humid tropical forest on Barro Colorado Island, Panama, reporting both among-and within-species variation in relation to light environment (sun-lit canopy versus shaded understorey) and ontogeny (seed-lings versus adults). In this dataset encompassing 281 free-standing woody species and 428 species-light combinations, lamina fracture toughness varied ca 10 times. A central objective of our study was to identify generalizable patterns in the structural and material basis for interspecific variation in leaf lamina fracture toughness. The leaf lamina is a heterogeneous structure in which strong materials in cell walls, such as cellulose and lignin, contribute disproportionately to fracture toughness. We found significant increases in leaf fracture toughness from shade to sun and from seedling leaves to adult leaves. Both within and across species, leaf fracture toughness increased with total bulk density (dry biomass per unit volume) and cellulose mass concentration, but decreased with mass concentrations of lignin and hemicel-luose. These bivariate relationships shift between light environments, but leaf cellulose density (cellulose mass per unit leaf volume) exhibits a common relationship with lamina fracture toughness between light environments and through ontogeny. Hence, leaf cellulose density is probably a universal predictor of leaf fracture toughness.},

  abstract = {Question How do multivariate methods perform in relating species- and community-level trait responses to the environment? Location (1) Field data from grazed semi-natural grasslands, NE Germany; (2) artificial data. Methods Research questions associated with trait\textendash environment relationships were briefly reviewed and seven available methods evaluated. The main distinction between research questions is whether trait\textendash environment relationships should be addressed at community or species level. A redundancy analysis (RDA) of mean trait values of species in a plot weighted by their abundances (CWM-RDA) is exclusively suitable for the community level. The other six methods address the species level. A double inertia analysis of two arrays (RLQ) and double canonical correspondence analysis (double CCA) use combinations of ordinations to simultaneously analyse species and trait responses to the environment. A combination of the outlying mean index with generalized additive models (OMI-GAM) predicts the response of species to environmental variables on trait gradients. RDA-RegTree first analyses species responses to the environment with RDA and then uses a regression tree to classify trait expressions according to scores of species responses on the ordination axes. Cluster regression uses cluster analyses and logistic regression to search for trait combinations with the best response to the environmental variables. This method models the distribution of functional groups on environmental gradients. All methods and data are available as R scripts. Results All methods consistently revealed the main trait responses to environment in the field data set, namely that life history was associated with available phosphorus while grazing intensity was related to leaf C:N ratio and canopy height. At community level, CWM-RDA gave a good overview of trait\textendash environment relationships, as also provided by the species-based methods RLQ and double CCA. OMI-GAM revealed non-linear relationships in the field data set. Field and artificial data gave that the number and stability of functional groups produced by Cluster regression and RDA-RegTree varied more strongly than RLQ, double CCA and OMI-GAM. Conclusions Each method addresses particular ecological concepts and research questions. If a user asks for the response of average trait expressions of communities to environmental gradients, CWM-RDA may be the first choice. However, species-based methods should be applied to address questions regarding co-existence of different life histories or to assess how groups of species respond to environmental changes. The artificial data set revealed that the methods differed in sensitivity to gradient lengths and random data.},

  abstract = {Plants store large amounts of non-structural carbohydrates (NSC). While multiple functions of NSC have long been recognized, the interpretation of NSC seasonal dynamics is often based on the idea that stored NSC is a reservoir of carbon that fluctuates depending on the balance between supply via photosynthesis and demand for growth and respiration (the source\textendash sink dynamics concept). Consequently, relatively high NSC concentrations in some plants have been interpreted to reflect excess supply relative to demand. An alternative view, however, is that NSC accumulation reflects the relatively high NSC levels required for plant survival; an important issue that remains highly controversial. Here, we assembled a new global database to examine broad patterns of seasonal NSC variation across organs (leaves, stems, and belowground), plant functional types (coniferous, drought-deciduous angiosperms, winter deciduous angiosperms, evergreen angiosperms, and herbaceous) and biomes (boreal, temperate, Mediterranean, and tropical). We compiled data from 121 studies, including seasonal measurements for 177 species under natural conditions. Our results showed that, on average, NSC account for 10\% of dry plant biomass and are highest in leaves and lowest in stems, whereas belowground organs show intermediate concentrations. Total NSC, starch, and soluble sugars (SS) varied seasonally, with a strong depletion of starch during the growing season and a general increase during winter months, particularly in boreal and temperate biomes. Across functional types, NSC concentrations were highest and most variable in herbaceous species and in conifer needles. Conifers showed the lowest stem and belowground NSC concentrations. Minimum NSC values were relatively high (46\% of seasonal maximums on average for total NSC) and, in contrast to average values, were similar among biomes and functional types. Overall, although starch depletion was relatively common, seasonal depletion of total NSC or SS was rare. These results are consistent with a dual view of NSC function: whereas starch acts mostly as a reservoir for future use, soluble sugars perform immediate functions (e.g., osmoregulation) and are kept above some critical threshold. If confirmed, this dual function of NSC will have important implications for the way we understand and model plant carbon allocation and survival under stress.},

References SUMMARY: Extensive within-canopy light gradients importantly affect the photosynthetic productivity of leaves in different canopy positions and lead to light-dependent increases in foliage photosynthetic capacity per area (AA ). However, the controls on AA variations by changes in underlying traits are poorly known. We constructed an unprecedented worldwide database including 831 within-canopy gradients with standardized light estimates for 304 species belonging to major vascular plant functional types, and analyzed within-canopy variations in 12 key foliage structural, chemical and physiological traits by quantitative separation of the contributions of different traits to photosynthetic acclimation. Although the light-dependent increase in AA is surprisingly similar in different plant functional types, they differ fundamentally in the share of the controls on AA by constituent traits. Species with high rates of canopy development and leaf turnover, exhibiting highly dynamic light environments, actively change AA by nitrogen reallocation among and partitioning within leaves. By contrast, species with slow leaf turnover exhibit a passive AA acclimation response, primarily determined by the acclimation of leaf structure to growth light. This review emphasizes that different combinations of traits are responsible for within-canopy photosynthetic acclimation in different plant functional types, and solves an old enigma of the role of mass- vs area-based traits in vegetation acclimation.},

We investigated photosynthetic N-use efficiency (photosynthetic capacity per unit N) in relation to N allocation to Rubisco and to cell walls in Polygonum cuspidatum Sieb. et Zucc. which germinated in May (early germinators) and August (late germinators). 2. There was a significant difference between early and late germinators in photo-synthetic capacity as a function of leaf N content per unit area. Higher photosynthetic N-use efficiency in late germinators was caused primarily by a larger allocation of N to Rubisco. 3. Nitrogen allocation to cell walls was smaller in late germinators. The shorter growth period in late germinators was associated with higher photosynthetic capacity, which was achieved by allocating more N to photosynthetic proteins at the expense of cell walls. 4. The trade-off between N allocation to photosynthesis and to structural tissues suggests that plants change N allocation to increase either the rate or duration of carbon assimilation. Such plastic change would help plants maintain themselves and cope with environmental changes.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Leaf mechanical properties, which are important to protect leaves against physical stresses, are thought to change with light and nutrient availabilities. This study aims to understand phenotypic changes of leaf mechanical properties with respect to dry mass allocation and anatomy. METHODS: Leaf lamina strength (maximum force per unit area to fracture), toughness (work to fracture) and stiffness (resistance against deformation) were measured by punch-and-die tests, and anatomical and physiological traits were determined in Plantago major plants grown at different light and nutrient availabilities. A conceptual approach was developed by which punch strength and related carbon costs can be quantitatively related to the underlying anatomical and morphological traits: leaf thickness, dry-mass allocation to cell walls and cell-wall-specific strength. KEY RESULTS: Leaf lamina strength, toughness and stiffness (all expressed on a punch area basis) increased with light availability. By contrast, nutrient availability did not change strength or toughness, but stiffness was higher in low-nutrient plants. Punch strength (maximum force per unit punch area, F(max)/area) was analysed as the product of leaf mass per area (LMA) and F(max)/leaf mass (= punch strength/LMA, indicating mass-use efficiency for strength). The greater strength of sun leaves was mainly explained by their higher LMA. Shade leaves, by contrast, had a higher F(max)/leaf mass. This greater efficiency in shade leaves was caused by a greater fraction of leaf mass in cell walls and by a greater specific strength of cell walls. These differences are probably because epidermis cells constitute a relatively large fraction of the leaf cross-section in shaded leaves. Although a larger percentage of intercellular spaces were found in shade leaves, this in itself did not reduce 'material' strength (punch strength/thickness); it might, however, be important for increasing distance between upper and lower epidermis per unit mass and thus maintaining flexural stiffness at minimal costs. CONCLUSIONS: The consequences of a reduced LMA for punch strength in shaded leaves was partially compensated for by a mechanically more efficient design, which, it is suggested, contributes importantly to resisting mechanical stress under carbon-limited conditions.},

Key measures of leaf mechanical resistance varied c. 500-800-fold among species. Contrary to a long-standing hypothesis, tropical leaves were not mechanically more resistant than temperate leaves. Leaf mechanical resistance was modestly related to rainfall and local light environment. By partitioning leaf mechanical resistance into three different components we discovered that toughness per density contributed a surprisingly large fraction to variation in mechanical resistance, larger than the fractions contributed by lamina thickness and tissue density. Higher toughness per density was associated with long leaf lifespan especially in forest understory. Seldom appreciated in the past, toughness per density is a key factor in leaf mechanical resistance, which itself influences plant-animal interactions and ecosystem functions across the globe.},

It has been repeatedly demonstrated that thicker cuticle is not superior as a water barrier, implying that other functions must be important. Here, we measured the mechanical properties, dry mass and density of isolated cuticle from 13 evergreen woody species of Australian forests. Summed adaxial and abaxial cuticle membrane mass per unit leaf area (CMA) varied from 2.95 to 27.4~g m(-2) across species, and accounted for 6.7-24\% of lamina dry mass. Density of cuticle varied only from 1.04 to 1.24~g~cm(-3) ; thus variation in CMA was mostly due to variation in cuticle thickness. Thicker cuticle was more resistant to tearing. Tensile strength and modulus of elasticity of cuticle were much higher than those of leaf laminas, with significant differences between adaxial and abaxial cuticles. While cuticle membranes were thin, they could account for a significant fraction of leaf dry mass due to their high density. The substantial cost of thicker cuticle is probably offset by increased mechanical resistance which might confer longer leaf lifespans among evergreen species.},

Yet, in much of the world's vege- tation species of different statures coexist. This study aims to clarify the mechanisms underlying this apparent paradox. 2. We quantified how co-occurring species and individuals intercepted and used light for growth in a mature, warm-temperate evergreen forest. This was performed by determining the 3D distribution of foliage and light with a ground-based lidar system in combination with nondestructive measure- ments of plant growth. 3. Taller trees intercepted light more efficiently per unit of above-ground biomass than shorter trees did (=higher light interception efficiency, LIE). However, taller trees tended to have lower biomass production per unit light interception (=lower light use efficiency, LUE). Reduced LUE in taller trees was associated with their higher biomass allocation to nonphotosynthetic organs and probably with over-saturated light intensity for photosynthesis at high canopy positions. Due to the increased LIE and decreased LUE with tree heights, a trade-off between LIE and LUE was found, and this trade-off resulted in trees of different statures having similar relative growth rates. 4. Synthesis. Light competition drives trees to grow taller, and the light interception efficiency is higher in taller trees; however, this benefit comes at a cost of decreased efficiency of light use for growth. This trade-off allows trees of different statures to grow at proportionally comparable rates and may promote coexistence of tree species in one-sided light competition.},

Leaf laminas are composed of thin epidermis layers and thicker intervening mesophyll layers, which resemble a composite material, i.e. sandwich structure, used in engineering constructions (e.g. airplane wings) where high bending stiffness with minimum weight is important. Yet, to what extent leaf laminas are mechanically designed and behave as a sandwich structure remains unclear. To resolve this issue, we developed and applied a novel method to estimate stiffness of epidermis- and mesophyll layers without separating the layers. Across a phylogenetically diverse range of 36 angiosperm species, the estimated Young's moduli (a measure of stiffness) of mesophyll layers were much lower than those of the epidermis layers, indicating that leaf laminas behaved similarly to efficient sandwich structures. The stiffness of epidermis layers was higher in evergreen species than in deciduous species, and strongly associated with cuticle thickness. The ubiquitous nature of sandwich structures in leaves across studied species suggests that the sandwich structure has evolutionary advantages as it enables leaves to be simultaneously thin and flat, efficiently capturing light and maintaining mechanical stability under various stresses.},

Much of the structure in the mass-normalized LES results from normalizing area-proportional traits by mass. Mass normalization induces strong correlations among area-proportional traits because of large variation among species in leaf mass per area (LMA). The high LMA variance likely reflects its functional relationship with leaf life span.

  abstract = {Understanding variation in leaf functional traits-including rates of photosynthesis and respiration and concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus-is a fundamental challenge in plant ecophysiology. When expressed per unit leaf area, these traits typically increase with leaf mass per area (LMA) within species but are roughly independent of LMA across the global flora. LMA is determined by mass components with different biological functions, including photosynthetic mass that largely determines metabolic rates and contains most nitrogen and phosphorus, and structural mass that affects toughness and leaf lifespan (LL). A possible explanation for the contrasting trait relationships is that most LMA variation within species is associated with variation in photosynthetic mass, whereas most LMA variation across the global flora is associated with variation in structural mass. This hypothesis leads to the predictions that (i) gas exchange rates and nutrient concentrations per unit leaf area should increase strongly with LMA across species assemblages with low LL variance but should increase weakly with LMA across species assemblages with high LL variance and that (ii) controlling for LL variation should increase the strength of the above LMA relationships. We present analyses of intra- and interspecific trait variation from three tropical forest sites and interspecific analyses within functional groups in a global dataset that are consistent with the above predictions. Our analysis suggests that the qualitatively different trait relationships exhibited by different leaf assemblages can be understood by considering the degree to which photosynthetic and structural mass components contribute to LMA variation in a given assemblage.},

To enable more generalized conclusions, three different systems were studied: top and the most-shaded leaves of 10 adult tree species in a European mixed forest, top leaves of sub-dominant trees of two evergreen species growing in small gaps or below the canopy in an Amazonian rainforest, and plants of six herbaceous and four woody species grown hydroponically at low or high irradiance in growth cabinets. Daily photon irradiance varied 3-6-fold between low- and high-light leaves. Specific leaf area (SLA) was 30-130\% higher at low light. Construction costs, on the other hand, were 1-5\% lower for low-irradiance leaves, mainly because low-irradiance leaves had lower concentrations of soluble phenolics. Photosynthetic capacity and respiration, expressed per unit leaf mass, were hardly different for the low- and high-light leaves. Estimates of payback times of the high-irradiance leaves ranged from 2-4 d in the growth cabinets, to 15-20 d for the adult tree species in the European forest. Low-irradiance leaves had payback times that were 2-3 times larger, ranging from 4 d in the growth cabinets to 20-80 d at the most shaded part of the canopy of the mixed forest. In all cases, estimated payback times were less than half the life span of the leaves, suggesting that even at time-integrated irradiances lower than 5\% of the total seasonal value, investment in leaves is still fruitful from a carbon-economy point of view. A sensitivity analysis showed that increased SLA of low-irradiance leaves was the main factor constraining payback times. Acclimation in the other five factors determining payback time, namely construction costs, photosynthetic capacity per unit leaf mass, respiration per unit leaf mass, apparent quantum yield, and curvature of the photosynthetic light-response-curve, were unimportant when the observed variation in each factor was examined.},

Dose-response curves of allocation were constructed by means of a meta-analysis from a wide array of experimental data. They show that the fraction of whole-plant mass represented by leaves (LMF) increases most strongly with nutrients and decreases most strongly with light. Correction for size-induced allocation patterns diminishes the LMF-response to light, but makes the effect of temperature on LMF more apparent. There is a clear phylogenetic effect on allocation, as eudicots invest relatively more than monocots in leaves, as do gymnosperms compared with woody angiosperms. Plants grown at high densities show a clear increase in the stem fraction. However, in most comparisons across species groups or environmental factors, the variation in LMF is smaller than the variation in one of the other components of the growth analysis equation: the leaf area : leaf mass ratio (SLA). In competitive situations, the stem mass fraction increases to a smaller extent than the specific stem length (stem length : stem mass). Thus, we conclude that plants generally are less able to adjust allocation than to alter organ morphology.},

My overarching hypothesis is that strong selection along trait trade-off axes, in tandem with biophysical constraints, results in convergence for any taxon on a uniformly fast, medium or slow strategy (i.e. rates of resource acquisition and processing) for all organs and all resources.\textbackslash n\textbackslash n\textbackslash n\textbackslash n*\textbackslash nEvidence for economic trait spectra exists for stems and roots as well as leaves, and for traits related to water as well as carbon and nutrients. These apply generally within and across scales (within and across communities, climate zones, biomes and lineages).\textbackslash n\textbackslash n\textbackslash n\textbackslash n*\textbackslash nThere are linkages across organs and coupling among resources, resulting in an integrated whole-plant economics spectrum.

  abstract = {1. In this paper we develop a theoretical framework for describing the composition and morphology of leaves on a volumetric basis which is inclusive of both the liquids and internal air space. That framework is then used to link the composition and morphology with the function of leaves. 2. Leaves are segmented into a functional scheme named a-u-s-V lair space-solution-structure-volume basis) and a measurement scheme named a-q-d-M lair space-liquid-dry matter-Mass basis). Measurements of mass, liquid mass, volume and fractional air space are necessary to (partially) link the two schemes. 3. The liquid content of leaves can be used to infer the mode of mechanical support and, hence, the likely values of air space, solution and structure. For example, if a leaf has a high liquid content, then it cannot have a large volumetric fraction of structure (which is largely made of dry matter) and is unlikely to have large internal air spaces. 4. Based on measurements of individual leaf components, the specific gravity of the non-gaseous fraction in leaves would usually be in the range 1-1.3. Consequently, the specific gravity of leaves would be most sensitive to variation in fractional air space. 5. For the dimensions typical of most leaves, the surface area to volume ratio of a leaf is determined by leaf thickness (or diameter). 6. Leaf design is considered in terms of light interception and gas exchange. The requirements for each are essentially incompatible and lead to a trade-off on leaf thickness. However, that relationship is complicated because Variation in fractional air space can potentially lead to broad optima for gas exchange at any given leaf thickness. 7. The theoretical predictions have not been assessed owing to a lack of measurements of leaf density, fractional air space and Liquid content. However, published data were used to develop the following hypotheses: (1) the mass of nitrogen per unit mass of liquid is relatively constant within leaves; (2) the surface area to volume ratio of leaves is proportional to leaf liquid content. These hypotheses are tested in a subsequent paper.},

We measured leaf mass per area (LMA), leaf nitrogen concentration (N), carbon isotope composition in leaves ({$\delta$}13C), stem wood density (WD), the Huber value (Hv, the ratio of cross-sectional sapwood area to leaf area), sapwood-specific and leaf-specific stem hydraulic conductivity (KS and KL, respectively), vulnerability to xylem embolism (P50) and the turgor loss point (Ptlp). ?Differences between families explained the largest amount of variability for most traits, although intraspecific variability was also relevant. Species occupying wetter sites showed higher N, P50 and Ptlp, and lower LMA, {$\delta$}13C and Hv. However, when trait relationships with water availability were assessed within species they held only for Hv and Ptlp. ?Overall, our results indicate that intraspecific adjustments along the water availability gradient relied primarily on changes in resource allocation between sapwood and leaf area and in leaf water relations.

We present a hierarchical view of sources of variation in leaf lifespan in tropical forests, emphasizing the importance of substantial within-species variation, which has rarely been addressed. Interspecific variation in leaf lifespan is positively correlated with LMA, varying from short-lived, low-LMA leaves to long-lived, high-LMA leaves of species associated with resource-rich versus resource-depleted habitats, respectively. Phenotypic responses of leaf lifespan and LMA to light show counter-gradient variation: with acclimation to shade, leaf lifespan increases, and LMA decreases, but both increase with adaptation to shade. In contrast, phenotypic responses to soil fertility are predicted to show co-gradient variation: both leaf lifespan and LMA increase with declining fertility both inter- and intraspecifically. We present new data analyses supporting these predictions, but the interactive effects of light and soil resources can produce complex phenotypic responses. Future studies of leaf lifespan should devote more attention to within-species variation to better quantify and explain how leaf lifespan is central to trade-offs generating the contrasting ecological strategies of tropical tree species.},

  abstract = {Functional diversity is critical for ecosystem dynamics, stability and productivity. However, dynamic global vegeta- tion models (DGVMs) which are increasingly used to simulate ecosystem functions under global change, condense functional diversity to plant functional types (PFTs) with constant parameters. Here, we develop an individual- and trait-based version of the DGVM LPJmL (Lund-Potsdam-Jena managed Land) called LPJmL- flexible individual traits (LPJmL-FIT) with flexible individual traits) which we apply to generate plant trait maps for the Amazon basin. LPJmL-FIT incorporates empirical ranges of five traits of tropical trees extracted from the TRY global plant trait data- base, namely specific leaf area (SLA), leaf longevity (LL), leaf nitrogen content (Narea), the maximum carboxylation rate of Rubisco per leaf area (vcmaxarea ), and wood density (WD). To scale the individual growth performance of trees, the leaf traits are linked by trade-offs based on the leaf economics spectrum, whereas wood density is linked to tree mortality. No preselection of growth strategies is taking place, because individuals with unique trait combinations are uniformly distributed at tree establishment. We validate the modeled trait distributions by empirical trait data and the modeled biomass by a remote sensing product along a climatic gradient. Including trait variability and trade- offs successfully predicts natural trait distributions and achieves a more realistic representation of functional diver- sity at the local to regional scale. As sites of high climatic variability, the fringes of the Amazon promote trait diver- gence and the coexistence of multiple tree growth strategies, while lower plant trait diversity is found in the species- rich center of the region with relatively low climatic variability. LPJmL-FIT enables to test hypotheses on the effects of functional biodiversity on ecosystem functioning and to apply the DGVM to current challenges in ecosystem man- agement from local to global scales, that is, deforestation and climate change effects.},

However, most models are limited by how they define vegetation and by their simplistic representation of competition. * We discuss how concepts from community assembly theory and coexistence theory can help to improve vegetation models. We further present a trait- and individual-based vegetation model (aDGVM2) that allows individual plants to adopt a unique combination of trait values. These traits define how individual plants grow and compete. A genetic optimization algorithm is used to simulate trait inheritance and reproductive isolation between individuals. These model properties allow the assembly of plant communities that are adapted to a site's biotic and abiotic conditions. * The aDGVM2 simulates how environmental conditions influence the trait spectra of plant communities; that fire selects for traits that enhance fire protection and reduces trait diversity; and the emergence of life-history strategies that are suggestive of colonization\textendash competition trade-offs. * The aDGVM2 deals with functional diversity and competition fundamentally differently from current DGVMs. This approach may yield novel insights as to how vegetation may respond to climate change and we believe it could foster collaborations between functional plant biologists and vegetation modellers.},

Capturing spatial and temporal variability in LMA has been a long-standing goal of ecological research and is an essential component for advancing Earth system models. Despite the substantial variation in LMA within and across Earth's biomes, an efficient, globally generalizable approach to predict LMA is still lacking. We explored the capacity to predict LMA from leaf spectra across much of the global LMA trait space, with values ranging from 17 g m-2 to 393 g m-2. Our dataset contained leaves from a wide range of biomes from the high Arctic to the tropics, included broad- and needle-leaf species, and upper and lower canopy (i.e. sun and shade) growth environments. Here we demonstrate the capacity to rapidly estimate LMA using only spectral measurements across a wide range of species, leaf age, and canopy position, from diverse biomes. Our model captures LMA variability with high accuracy and low error (R2=0.89; RMSE=15.45 g m-2) Our finding highlights that the leaf economic spectrum is mirrored by the leaf optical spectrum paving the way for this technology to predict the diversity of LMA in ecosystems across global biomes.

In principle, it provides carbon backbones for nitrogen assimilation and evolves CO2 and thus impacts on plant carbon and nitrogen balances. However, for a long time, uncertainties have remained as to whether techniques used to measure day respiratory efflux were valid and whether day respiration responded to environmental gaseous conditions. In the past few years, significant advances have been made using carbon isotopes, `omics' analyses and surveys of respiration rates in mesocosms or ecosystems. There is substantial evidence that day respiration should be viewed as a highly dynamic metabolic pathway that interacts with photosynthesis and photorespiration and responds to atmospheric CO2 mole fraction. The view of leaf day respiration as a constant and/or negligible parameter of net carbon exchange is now outdated and it should now be regarded as a central actor of plant carbon-use efficiency.},

Because resistance to CO2 diffusion from the substomatal cavity to the stroma is substantial, it is likely that mesophyll structure affects A through affecting diffusion of CO2 in the leaf. To evaluate effects of various aspects of mesophyll structure on photosynthesis, we constructed a one-dimensional model of CO2 diffusion in the leaf. When mesophyll thickness of the leaf is changed with the Rubisco content per unit leaf area kept constant, the maximum A occurs at an almost identical mesophyll thickness irrespective of the Rubisco contents per leaf area. On the other hand, with an increase in Rubisco content per leaf area, the mesophyll thickness that realizes a given photosynthetic gain per mesophyll thickness (or per leaf cost) increases This probably explains the strong relationship between A and mesephyll thickness. In these simulations, an increase in mesophyll thickness simultaneously means an increase in the diffusional resistance in the intercellular spaces (R-ias), an increase in the total surface area of chloroplasts facing the intercellular spaces per unit leaf area (S-c), and an increase in construction and maintenance cost of the leaf. Leaves can increase S-c and decrease R-ias also by decreasing cell size. Leaves with smaller cells are mechanically stronger. However,actual leaves do not have very small cells. This could be because actual leaves exhibiting considerable rates of leaf area expansion, adequate heat capacitance, high efficiency of N and/or P use, etc, are favoured. Relationships between leaf longevity and mesophyll structure are also discussed.},

The first seeks to answer the question: why are sun leaves thicker than shade leaves? To do this, CO2 diffusion within a leaf is examined first. Because affinity of Rubisco for CO2 is low, the carboxylation of ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate is competitively inhibited by O2, and the oxygenation of ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate leads to energy-consuming photorespiration, it is essential for C3 plants to maintain the CO2 concentration in the chloroplast as high as possible. Since the internal conductance for CO2 diffusion from the intercellular space to the chloroplast stroma is finite and relatively small, C3 leaves should have sufficient mesophyll surfaces occupied by chloroplasts to secure the area for CO2 dissolution and transport. This explains why sun leaves are thicker. The second approach is mechanistic or 'how-oriented'. Mechanisms are discussed as to how sun leaves become thicker than shade leaves, in particular, the long-distance signal transduction from mature leaves to leaf primordia inducing the periclinal division of the palisade tissue cells. To increase the mesophyll surface area, the leaf can either be thicker or have smaller cells. Issues of cell size are discussed to understand plasticity in leaf thickness.},

First, we analyze the conductance for CO2 diffusion from the substomatal cavity to the chloroplast stroma (mesophyll conductance, gm, also called internal conductance, gi). Because the low gm limits photosynthesis, the mesophyll surface area exposed to the intercellular spaces (Smes, mesophyll surface area exposed to intercellular spaces per unit leaf area) should be maximized to increase the area for CO2 dissolution and the effective pathway for CO2 diffusion, and thereby photosynthesis. Second, we analyze the light environment within a leaf, because, for maximizing photosynthesis, light should be delivered to all the chloroplasts in the leaf, distributing along the cell walls. In relation to the light environment within a leaf, we also point out some technical problems in measuring photosynthetic parameters.

  abstract = {The future predictive performance of a Bayesian model can be estimated using Bayesian cross-validation. In this article, we consider Gaussian latent variable models where the integration over the latent values is approximated using the Laplace method or expectation propagation (EP). We study the properties of several Bayesian leave-one-out (LOO) cross-validation approximations that in most cases can be computed with a small additional cost after forming the posterior approximation given the full data. Our main objective is to assess the accuracy of the approximative LOO cross-validation estimators. That is, for each method (Laplace and EP) we compare the approximate fast computation with the exact brute force LOO computation. Secondarily, we evaluate the accuracy of the Laplace and EP approximations themselves against a ground truth established through extensive Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation. Our empirical results show that the approach based upon a Gaussian approximation to the LOO marginal distribution (the so-called cavity distribution) gives the most accurate and reliable results among the fast methods.},

  abstract = {Importance weighting is a convenient general way to adjust for draws from the wrong distribution, but the resulting ratio estimate can be noisy when the importance weights have a heavy right tail, as routinely occurs when there are aspects of the target distribution not well captured by the approximating distribution. More stable estimates can be obtained by truncating the importance ratios. Here we present a new method for stabilizing importance weights using a generalized Pareto distribution fit to the upper tail of the distribution of the simulated importance ratios. The method includes stabilized effective sample estimates, Monte Carlo error estimates and convergence diagnostics.},

LOO and WAIC have various advantages over simpler estimates of predictive error such as AIC and DIC but are less used in practice because they involve additional computational steps. Here we lay out fast and stable computations for LOO and WAIC that can be performed using existing simulation draws. We introduce an efficient computation of LOO using Pareto-smoothed importance sampling (PSIS), a new procedure for regularizing importance weights. Although WAIC is asymptotically equal to LOO, we demonstrate that PSIS-LOO is more robust in the finite case with weak priors or influential observations. As a byproduct of our calculations, we also obtain approximate standard errors for estimated predictive errors and for comparing of predictive errors between two models. We implement the computations in an R package called 'loo' and demonstrate using models fit with the Bayesian inference package Stan.},

There exists an informal shortlist of plant traits that are thought to be most informative. Here, we summarize recent research on correlations and tradeoffs surrounding some traits that are prospects for the shortlist.

Categories along the spectrum would, in general, describe leaf economic variation at the global scale better than plant functional types overlap substantially in their leaf traits. Overall, modulation of leaf traits and trait relationships by climate is surprisingly modest, although some striking and significant patterns can be seen.

  abstract = {Aim Our aim was to quantify climatic influences on key leaf traits and relationships at the global scale. This knowledge provides insight into how plants have adapted to different environmental pressures, and will lead to better calibration of future vegetation-climate models. Location The data set represents vegetation from 175 sites around the world. Methods For more than 2500 vascular plant species, we compiled data on leaf mass per area (LMA), leaf life span (LL), nitrogen concentration (N(mass)) and photosynthetic capacity (A(mass)). Site climate was described with several standard indices. Correlation and regression analyses were used for quantifying relationships between single leaf traits and climate. Standardized major axis (SMA) analyses were used for assessing the effect of climate on bivariate relationships between leaf traits. Principal components analysis (PCA) was used to summarize multidimensional trait variation. Results At hotter, drier and higher irradiance sites, (1) mean LMA and leaf N per area were higher; (2) average LL was shorter at a given LMA, or the increase in LL was less for a given increase in LMA (LL-LMA relationships became less positive); and (3) A(mass) was lower at a given N(mass), or the increase in A(mass) was less for a given increase in N(mass). Considering all traits simultaneously, 18\% of variation along the principal multivariate trait axis was explained by climate. Main conclusions Trait-shifts with climate were of sufficient magnitude to have major implications for plant dry mass and nutrient economics, and represent substantial selective pressures associated with adaptation to different climatic regimes.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Earth system models describe the physical, chemical and biological processes that govern our global climate. While it is difficult to single out one component as being more important than another in these sophisticated models, terrestrial vegetation is a critical player in the biogeochemical and biophysical dynamics of the Earth system. There is much debate, however, as to how plant diversity and function should be represented in these models. SCOPE: Plant functional types (PFTs) have been adopted by modellers to represent broad groupings of plant species that share similar characteristics (e.g. growth form) and roles (e.g. photosynthetic pathway) in ecosystem function. In this review, the PFT concept is traced from its origin in the early 1800s to its current use in regional and global dynamic vegetation models (DVMs). Special attention is given to the representation and parameterization of PFTs and to validation and benchmarking of predicted patterns of vegetation distribution in high-latitude ecosystems. These ecosystems are sensitive to changing climate and thus provide a useful test case for model-based simulations of past, current and future distribution of vegetation. CONCLUSIONS: Models that incorporate the PFT concept predict many of the emerging patterns of vegetation change in tundra and boreal forests, given known processes of tree mortality, treeline migration and shrub expansion. However, representation of above- and especially below-ground traits for specific PFTs continues to be problematic. Potential solutions include developing trait databases and replacing fixed parameters for PFTs with formulations based on trait co-variance and empirical trait-environment relationships. Surprisingly, despite being important to land-atmosphere interactions of carbon, water and energy, PFTs such as moss and lichen are largely absent from DVMs. Close collaboration among those involved in modelling with the disciplines of taxonomy, biogeography, ecology and remote sensing will be required if we are to overcome these and other shortcomings.},

Current theories of LL that are based on carbon optimisation principles are challenging to quantitatively assess because of uncertainty across species in the `ageing rate:' the rate at which leaf photosynthetic capacity declines with age. Here, we present a meta-analysis of 49 species across temperate and tropical biomes, demonstrating that the ageing rate of photosynthetic capacity is positively correlated with the mass-based carboxylation rate of mature leaves. We assess an improved trait-driven carbon optimality model with in~situLL data for 105 species in two Panamanian forests. We show that our model explains over 40\% of the cross-species variation in LL under contrasting light environment. Collectively, our results reveal how variation in LL emerges from carbon optimisation constrained by both leaf structural traits and abiotic environment.},
